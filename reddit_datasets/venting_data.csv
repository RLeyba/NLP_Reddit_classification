Specifically, the idea of biology was so fascinating and intriguing to me that my childhood heroes were Bill Nye and animal conservationists like Steve Irwin and Jane Goodall. Endless hours of my life were dedicated to documentaries and books. I spent much of my free time in the libraries and stuff just absorbing information about the natural world.

I joined the military out of school, however, and had to place my career on the back burner. In the navy, I served as an FMF corpsman and unfortunately saw a lot of gruesome shit. All of this eventually led to severe anxiety and eventually, when I got it through my head that something was wrong, saw a psychiatrist at the VA who diagnosed me with PTSD. By this point in my life, I had gotten out of the military and had been working at my hometown emergency room. There, I was privy to witnessing the tragedy of the opioid epidemic first hand. People I had partied with in high school were dying in front of me. One of my best friends who shared summers with me killed himself this way leaving me with only the memories of riding our bikes together to the 711 to get slurpees. Eventually, this continued on in our community so pervasively that we couldn’t even organize our reunion as those who were local and able to attend could only be found in graveyards or within urns.

It was then that I finally got the courage to go back to school. My doctors said that the work environment I was in was not suitable for a healthy emotional state and they convinced me to finally chase my childhood dream to be a scientist. I got the courage to do it and at the age of thirty, I left my job and went to school full time. To say this was a rush of anxiety and fear would be an understatement. 

The first semester wasn’t as smooth as I’d hoped. I passed one of my classes well enough but I wasn’t prepared for the workload. So, the next semester, I chose to be more conscious of my time management. But every time I had algebra, I would freak out. For no other class did this to me. The anxiety and fear led to another failed attempt. The second failed attempt at algebra certainly didn’t improve my mental station. But, in the face of adversity, I enrolled a third time. 

This time, the professor started out by putting problems from the final exam on the board and telling us to complete them. After ten minutes, she told us to put our pencils down. She then stated that if we were unable to finish all of these problems, we should drop the class and if we had a problem with it, we would have to take it up with the dean since she was the department chair. Some of this was MyMathLab which is Satan incarnate as far as computer programs are concerned. For those who haven’t had the pleasure, basically, if your answer is right and your math is on-point but there is a space after an open parentheses, it marks you wrong but doesn’t tell you why leaving you to do and redo the problem incorrect ways to try and do it right yet, 100% of her homework grades were dependent upon this program. Suffice it to say I’m doing terribly and about to fail a third time.

I cannot honestly describe how gut-wrenching it is to have to change course on a childhood dream because I am simply not good enough; because I couldn’t get through a course that so many others can easily slide through. I’m not even all the sure that I have an appropriate GPA to get approval for another semester if I do choose to change majors. and that is if I can figure out where to go at this point. I feel demoralized, defeated, and full of shame. Sincerely, I don’t know what to do at this point. The people around me keep telling me the same shit. “Hang in there.” “It will be okay.” But these are just responses that I can’t accept because it isn’t okay.

That even if you hold out your hand  numerous times, people never take it?  That you end up left with an empty space inside? Honestly, I feel that every day and I am beginning to think that I’m not good at connecting with people… not in the way I want.

I remember, there was a time before I moved… that I have numerous friends. I was the center of attention in school. Made friends easily, and wasn’t always ‘alone’. Even if my own dad treated me like I wasn’t important, I didn’t feel the pain.. Because I could make a connection with others around me. I was happy, regardless of the abuse, I went through….

Than.. we moved… new place away from those I loved. From those that I was close with, and the place I could fit in. The new school I went to… slowly became hell. I thought I would make friends, just like I did in my old town… but that wasn’t the case.. Before, I could try.. I was labeled the ‘Outsider’. I was a very cute child, and pretty outgoing. I had confidence in myself, and wasn’t afraid…. I tried many times, and it never worked out. My birthday Parties, which use to be filled with my friends… became just siblings and parents. It was fine, because we were new to this place. I didn’t worry about it..because I had my sister, whom was my best friend.

And as Time went on and the abuse became worse… I lost confidence and stopped trying to make friends. Instead, I wanted to fit in. Find a place that will just accept me, and nothing worked. It all became… fruitless. Instead, the bullying became worse. .. and the happy child… became filled with despair, hate and anger…  I never had a say in anything, so I lashed out and became the bully, at the time everyone was picking on this kid… but that made things worse for me… . I’m not proud of being a bully, I was angry and hurt and wanted someone to see it… but, when my dad found out.. It became a nightmare… he wanted to teach me another painful lesson.I remember… He bound my legs and blindfolded my sister… at first my sister and I laughed thinking it was fun… seeing as we’re kids, and not old enough to understand… but this made him angry… and since I was a child he hated… he made it worse for me… He made sure I couldn’t move, see or hear…  I can’t remember what happened next, but I am 100% sure it wasn’t good, because I developed severe panic attacks and anxiety after that.. And an intense fear of men. IT still makes me shake typing this… and I can’t remember what else happened.

After that… I stopped bullying the kid, instead my hate grew.. And I stopped being close with my sister. She made living in that house harder… because of her, I’d get a beating… when she cut the dog’s hair and placed it in front of my door…. He grabbed the belt with many metal holes… and used it. Calling me a liar, when I wasn’t lying…. It hurt so much and I cried a lot… the worst part is when he found out it was actually my sister… He pretended to punish her. While I had to hide my bruises…

Time went on, until finally my mom threw him out, he had tried to kill her again.

And accepted the 0. I had hoped… that school would help me… in some ways, it did… but in other ways, not so much.Mmh… I ended up with a really good friend, someone I loved hanging out with…. We were always together.. Until the end of middle school…. That’s where she cut all ties. I never got to talk to her again…  She cut me out of her life…. That would be the second time someone did that to me…

Highschool came around… and it was alright. Not as bad or tragic as the other school experiences. Everyone treated me like a mod character, which I enjoyed.  I gained friends, and even a new best friend… that lasted until a year ago… when she posted photos of her wedding… I was there when they got engaged… honestly, She and I had always been close together, never apart and really good friends… but yea… third time in my life…A year after graduation… I found someone special… He was different… and was like fire to me. He was on a different level than I was and that made me excited to become close to him. As the years went by, he walked away from me 2xs… honestly, he walked away from me… everytime I needed him.. He’s a very selfish man, with a king complex… that’s for sure. Anything… I choose not to turn back, so I went forward… I hated my job and didn\[‘t have nothing going for me. So, I found a new one last year, I was torn between cutting my hours at the old one, to get my full month of training in… or prolonging the training…. Until, as if by fate, they let me go after my 4th anniversary… honestly, when I was given the news about my termination from the company… I was relieved.. And also… very happy about it. … granted I did cry for an hour after losing it, but that’s because I am actually a crybaby when it comes to losing things… but being let go was the best thing to happen to me… because I found a job…. That doesn’t make me hate myself and.. What’s amazing is… I get paid 3xs more… for less hours. It’s extremely fun and I can be social all the time….

But I still can’t help but feel lonely… I haven’t had sex with anyone and I’m almost 31… I still get scared of men, but it’s a lot less than before. My anxiety has become.. Almost nonexistent, with rare flare ups. When I think about this… I get frustrated with myself.. But I don’t want a meaningless fling..,, honestly, no guy has ever asked me out… except for one… but that was a dead end. I just wanted a friend. Lol.. granted.. There are some guys that talk to me… but I refuse to sleep with anyone, because it’s really pointless. I prefer a wholesome connection.. To a sensational one… after all, I know those types of relationships do exist and it’s amazing… because I actually feel whole in them… of course, this is with ONE guy… and the only one i was with…

Anyway… long story short.. I miss having someone close to me… boyfriend or just a friend… I miss it…. But it seems… I’m probably destined to be alone… and it sucks... because I really did try to connect with others...

Also, Therapy doens't help... in my opinion, it never has.... but that's a completely different venting all together... and I don't want to keep into that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like you’re lost in a sea of loneliness? That even if you hold out your hand  numerous times, people never take it?  That you end up left with an empty space inside? Honestly, I feel that every day and I am beginning to think that I’m not good at connecting with people… not in the way I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember, there was a time before I moved… that I have numerous friends. I was the center of attention in school. Made friends easily, and wasn’t always ‘alone’. Even if my own dad treated me like I wasn’t important, I didn’t feel the pain.. Because I could make a connection with others around me. I was happy, regardless of the abuse, I went through….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than.. we moved… new place away from those I loved. From those that I was close with, and the place I could fit in. The new school I went to… slowly became hell. I thought I would make friends, just like I did in my old town… but that wasn’t the case.. Before, I could try.. I was labeled the ‘Outsider’. I was a very cute child, and pretty outgoing. I had confidence in myself, and wasn’t afraid…. I tried many times, and it never worked out. My birthday Parties, which use to be filled with my friends… became just siblings and parents. It was fine, because we were new to this place. I didn’t worry about it..because I had my sister, whom was my best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as Time went on and the abuse became worse… I lost confidence and stopped trying to make friends. Instead, I wanted to fit in. Find a place that will just accept me, and nothing worked. It all became… fruitless. Instead, the bullying became worse. .. and the happy child… became filled with despair, hate and anger…  I never had a say in anything, so I lashed out and became the bully, at the time everyone was picking on this kid… but that made things worse for me… . I’m not proud of being a bully, I was angry and hurt and wanted someone to see it… but, when my dad found out.. It became a nightmare… he wanted to teach me another painful lesson.I remember… He bound my legs and blindfolded my sister… at first my sister and I laughed thinking it was fun… seeing as we’re kids, and not old enough to understand… but this made him angry… and since I was a child he hated… he made it worse for me… He made sure I couldn’t move, see or hear…  I can’t remember what happened next, but I am 100% sure it wasn’t good, because I developed severe panic attacks and anxiety after that.. And an intense fear of men. IT still makes me shake typing this… and I can’t remember what else happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that… I stopped bullying the kid, instead my hate grew.. And I stopped being close with my sister. She made living in that house harder… because of her, I’d get a beating… when she cut the dog’s hair and placed it in front of my door…. He grabbed the belt with many metal holes… and used it. Calling me a liar, when I wasn’t lying…. It hurt so much and I cried a lot… the worst part is when he found out it was actually my sister… He pretended to punish her. While I had to hide my bruises…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time went on, until finally my mom threw him out, he had tried to kill her again. To be honest, I was happy he was gone… but I was angry at my own mom for not doing it sooner… That’s when she chose to put us in therapy… but honestly, that didn’t help me… at all.

So I met this guy 2 weeks ago and for the past two weeks we've been texting and talking a lot. We have a lot in common and he was really adamant on wanting to move forward and looking for a relationship. At first I was a little apprehensive due to being burned in the past but I enjoy talking to him and look forward to hearing from him. 

We scheduled our first date to be dinner and movie, it was a movie we both really wanted to see. The day before our scheduled date he was texting me back and forth regarding how he was excited and where we should go eat and what time should we meet up. Then the day of the date he says that it's too hot to go out to eat even though we hadn't made final plans yet. Then he tried to change what movie we wanted to see.

After going back and forth for a little bit we decided to stick to the movie we agreed on and go to the 6 show. At at 2 p.m. he was running errands  and we were texting back and forth about where we should meet and he told me when he left just or he would call me and that he was super excited to see me. At 3 p.m. I text him asking him if he forgot about me, got no response. At 4:30 p.m. I text asking if he changed his mind, got no response. At 5:30 I called him and his phone went straight to voicemail, and playing off of a hunch I called him on my son's phone and his phone rang. To which then I text and said that I can take a hint and I will be deleting his contact information.

So my reason for posting all of this was to ask what was the point of it? He pursued me, he made the arrangements, he went through all the effort to get my attention and to get me interested in him......... just took ghost me before our first date? What was the point?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this short but I really need some advice or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a lot in common and he was really adamant on wanting to move forward and looking for a relationship. At first I was a little apprehensive due to being burned in the past but I enjoy talking to him and look forward to hearing from him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scheduled our first date to be dinner and movie, it was a movie we both really wanted to see. The day before our scheduled date he was texting me back and forth regarding how he was excited and where we should go eat and what time should we meet up. Then the day of the date he says that it&amp;#39;s too hot to go out to eat even though we hadn&amp;#39;t made final plans yet. Then he tried to change what movie we wanted to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going back and forth for a little bit we decided to stick to the movie we agreed on and go to the 6 show. At at 2 p.m. he was running errands  and we were texting back and forth about where we should meet and he told me when he left just or he would call me and that he was super excited to see me. At 3 p.m. I text him asking him if he forgot about me, got no response. At 4:30 p.m. I text asking if he changed his mind, got no response. At 5:30 I called him and his phone went straight to voicemail, and playing off of a hunch I called him on my son&amp;#39;s phone and his phone rang. To which then I text and said that I can take a hint and I will be deleting his contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my reason for posting all of this was to ask what was the point of it? He pursued me, he made the arrangements, he went through all the effort to get my attention and to get me interested in him......... just took ghost me before our first date? What was the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in my late teens/early 20's my brother and I worked at a fast food restaurant, and sometimes hung out with some of my co workers. One night my brother and I were out with 3 others, and he was driving. We decided to go to the restaurant and see who's working and say hi. This restaurant had 2 drive thru windows, and my brother decided he wanted to joke around. The second someone came to the window to say hi he drove to the second window sorta cutting off the conversation. Then when he got to the second window and someone came, he did the same thing but reversed back the the first. He did this back and forth thing a two times and everyone inside was laughing. I kept telling him to stop since he was backing up too fast and he could crash into another car going through the drive thru. Hes sorta in the moment and doesn't listen to me and keeps doing it. So my brother is at the second drive thru, and backs up for the third time, and we hear a crash. The car stalls as if its caught on something, and were all confused. Here we find out one of the girls in the back decided to get out of the car right when he decided to reverse and the door hit one of the metal posts on the corner of the drive thru. Her pinky also happened to get caught between the door and the post, and was cut really bad. She was sitting in the rear passenger door behind the driver, and just got out without saying anything. We all got out to see what happened, and saw the door all bent up, and the girl holding her pinky in pain. She went to the hospital to get stitches and we were all wondering why the hell did she get out of the car? Anyway after that innocent the girl blamed my brother for ""trying to cut off her finger,"" and would always bring it up every now and then. She would spin the story to make herself out to be the victim, and then others would feel bad, and get pissed at my brother. It was both of their fault for the accident and my brother felt horrible for what happened. What pissed me off is other people would believe her even though they didn't know the whole story. You can imagine how frustrating that can be.... This all took place about 10 years ago but I still remember it vividly.

Anyway a few months ago I'm at the doctors, waiting in the examination room and guess who walks in? Yup, she happens to be an assistant nurse at the doctors office I newly switched over to. I havent seen her in so long, and she decides to make small talk with me. Even though I never really liked her, I remain civil. Another nurse comes in and she says "" oh by the way, I told her about how you tried to cut off my finger."" The other nurse sorta looks at me like she didnt want anything to do with the conversation and keeps to herself. I reply ( trying to keep it cool mind you) ""you mean the freak accident when you got out of a moving car?"" She replies ""not true"", and I go "" and It was my brother who drove...not me."" She sorta chuckles it off, but I remain looking at her like WTF. I mean why the hell would you bring that up after so long? Especially in front of others. It just got me so angry, and I switched doctors. Anyway, I just needed to vent about this and see if maybe anyone can relate. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have a tendency to reflect on bad things in the past that happened to me.

At this point I don’t even know if I want a girlfriend, just sex, or to experience romantic things




Long version:

My thoughts have been all over the place ever since I had a rather strange dream last week. The dream itself wasn’t all that strange, the events were actually quite clear, but still. I’m not going into detail of the dream, since it’s not all that important. Anyways, before that dream, I was pretty much always thinking about how I want, or maybe even need (in my head) a girlfriend. To me, having a girlfriend sounds like a portal to happiness. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not some depressed af person, but if anything, I do feel down quite a lot. Most of the time, that’s because I just feel lonely and think a girlfriend can fix this.
However, ever since that dream, I’ve been thinking about how I don’t need a girlfriend and I might as well settle for just sex. Considering that I’m a 19 year old virgin who has never had a girlfriend before, I feel like it sounds pretty fair. I mean, I know it’s not something to worry about, but people age 15-16 are out there having actual relationships and having more sex than I can imagine.
At this point, I might just start being a desperate piece of shit and get my ass on Tinder, be direct with all the matches I get (if I even get any) and probably just get down to business with it. Surely losing my virginity is actually easier than I think.
However, by just doing that, I’m kinda going against my sort of ideal that, since I’ve been single and virgin for so long, I might as well wait till I can do it with someone I actually like/love, which would make the wait actually worth it.
I’m not really asking for advice here, but it sure as hell is welcome. If anything, I’m just happy I wrote this shit out for myself and got it off my chest.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short version:&lt;/p&gt;

My mother always just calls me lazy and blames it on the internet but honestly I just sit in my bed and think a lot. 
I also find it mentally exhausting and almost pointless to take care of my basic hygiene. I almost never shower or wash my face, and everybody always tells me it's disgusting. I know it is but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't just take a shower because it's not supposed to be hard. 
Getting up and leaving the house is something my mom always forces me to do but it always makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around people makes me uncomfortable, I barely ever talk to my mom and she always takes personal offense to it. She always makes me feel bad about it and guilts me into hanging out with her  by saying that I'm so ungrateful because I have a perfectly good mom and I never talk to her. But then we argue about me being unmotivated and she doesn't take me seriously. She just says I'm lazy and doing nothing will make me feel worse. 
I've been becoming underweight recently because I never really feel hungry and don't often leave my room. My mom makes me feel worse about that too, instead of being kind enough to ask why I never eat she just threatens to send me to the hospital and screams at me. I'm only 90 pounds while being 5'5 and you can see most of my bones. 
I feel as if my ""depression"" ((if I even have it)) is making my mom hate me. She works full time and goes to college and I guess it stresses her out that I never clean up or get anything done. She gets angry because I don't make myself food since I don't Really care and she has to force me to eat instead of sleeping or doing schoolwork. 
I think I'm just a burden on her and my family since I can barely even take care of myself or act like a normal human being. She even blames me for losing all of my friends because I can't even act normal and I'm always upset about something. I'm starting to think that this isn't even depression and I'm just a shitty human being.

You were re-diagnosed with cancer (for a second time). I remember the first time you told me you had had cancer at one point(probably the second time we saw each other), unknowing that the cancer was back in your body, that you wouldn’t treat it again. It took too much out of you. It was too painful. It was just too much. 

It all happened fast. We fell in love fast, which I thought was lust but turns out to be something I’ve never really experienced before. An instant connection that led to instant feelings that led into instant love. 

What else happened fast, was the cancer coming back into your life.

It could have been a false positive you hoped. But it came back worse than expected, a lot worse. You hadn’t even discussed options with a doctor by the time you went to the hospital. You’re back now. You seem fine until you get a ridiculous amount of pain all at once. 

I watch from afar, closely, whatever you ask of me. But I know what’s coming. I can feel it. Maybe I’m wrong for being so pessimistic.

Next week, you talk about options. Treatments, decisions, things that you don’t want me to have to see. 

You’ve been honest, I will not be your lover if it’s bad or it gets bad. It’s already bad, but we just don’t know how bad. I will trust you, but it will be difficult to let go of this. 

This isn’t getting in the way of my day to day life. You told me not to let it, and i am trying my best not too. I’ve never lost anyone close to me before. 

What comforts me is the fact if you do pass, we experienced our own little infinity. Which is too cheesy, and I don’t like cheesy things, but it’s comforting to know the time we would have spent together was amazing and full of love and memories. 

What doesn’t comfort me is what you’ll be leaving behind. I could care less about me. What about your family? What about colleagues that love you and cherish you? 

I just have to trust you know best. I have to trust that you will make the right choice for you, and no one else. I will hurt, but I won’t be broken.

Bf and I live on the first floor, we have a separate entrance but only one room that is done - bedroom, and because of that we have to go down if we want to go to the bathroom or to eat. 

That sucks a lot, because first of all, I'm very anxious and I'm used to being alone, and now I'm in that house surrounded with people, second I really feel uncomfortable about laundry and the fact that his mom or grandma wake up in half past 5 and get shit done which includes hanging laundry so it can dry (my biggest prob is underwear, I just don't want anyone touching it), so I recently decided to wash my boyfriend's and mine clothes separately when his mom is working, so I can feel more comfortable.. BUT

The fact that his sister is a very annoying, spoiled slutty bitch (18yo btw), and that she's not ever asked to do shit really bothers the fuck out of me. And also even tho I started washing our clothes separately their mom still asks me to hang their laundry.. 

I'm currently not working so I'm home all the time, studying and stuff, and since I'm not currently making any money or helping with it, I do tend to help with everything I can, but it really bothers me when their mom tells me to hang laundry even tho it contains 80% of his sisters thongs and bras (that I of course don't want to even look at not to speak of me touching it) even tho the princess is sitting in her room probably taking selfies. 
The girl even wears thongs to the pool!
Huhh, writing this down makes me feel even more angry.. 

Also, what gets me really pissed is when their mom asks me to make lunch and in a certain time because her princess will be home soon and hungry.. I just loose my damn mind over that.. 

The little bitch also took some stuff from me when bf and I were in another country working, without even asking including a makeup palette that she than borrowed to a friend who broke it, even tho we asked her if she took it and even tho we were looking for that palette for about 6 months.. Also I could tell she wore some of my clothes.. 

When I borrowed my kit for fake nails to her, she completely ruined and stained everything and it took her also about 6 months to return it all (and we live in the same fucking house!).. And I keep my stuff very neat and tidy, I'm a perfectionist, yeah..

Look, every time she does smt that's not cool my boyfriend sticks up for me and argues with her and their mom (bcs mom stands on her daughter's side no matter what obviously) about it, but little shit is just unbelievably rude and spoiled that you can't make a simple deal or agreement with her. 

Basically I told my boyfriend that when we finish a bathroom and a kitchen on our floor (which is going to be done in a couple of months, I hope so) that I won't do anything else for anyone of them (his family) except for the two of us, and he basically understands and is totally okay with that, which is good. 
Also, if they continue to ask for favours, we'll move out. 

Our goal is to make some money and start building our own house, and I can't wait for that, and I hope that it'll happen in a couple of years tops..

And at one point he casually asked me if I am dating anyone. I told him just a straight no, not for a few years, then he proceeds to ask me if I’m a VIRGIN. And I say that I am. Mind you, I’m a 25 year old male.  I find it really concerning that not only did he looked Offended that I was Virgin, but that he himself had a “Buddy” which he had A sexual encounter with. At 12 years old......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how you look at it, that’s all wrong on several sides. I was raised up to believe that our bodies are Temples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I strongly believe in being a just person 100 Percent of the time. And frequently I feel like an outsider because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have that same feeling ?&lt;/p&gt;

My life recently has been a puddle of - meh. I find wanting to do things difficult, even things that sound fun like hiking or swimming. I am short with my SO when I would like to be kind. I lack the willpower to get myself outside when the day is pleasant. Through each day I find myself wanting so much more than what I have and needing to create when instead I consume. I play games because it's easy, I don't have to move or think about the things I am responsible for. I ignore my surroundings and lack initiation.

​

I go to the rock gym almost 3 times a week to get fun exercise in but while I'm there I can only will myself to try so hard before wanting to lay down and sleep. I feel like I'm wading through sludge just to do simple tasks. Even as I type this I can't help but feel like there is a ball and chain attached to the base of my skull. A tension headache is what the doctors called it.

​

For the past 6 years this headache has been gnawing at my psyche. The pain can range anywhere from a 1 on my better days to a 4 when I am stressed in life. 24/7. 6 years. Well anyways it can be more than a little discouraging to do anything when I imagine the amount of energy I have to exert just to get through the headache and fatigue.

​

I have a CPAP but I have been struggling to use it for the past 2 years. I either tear it off in my sleep or I choose not to wear it at all. I became hopeless when my doctor said that the CPAP was making my CSA worse and that using the CPAP may eventually get better if I use it more. Well instead of taking that as a challenge to try the CPAP I let myself fall to the bottom of a well. Mentally of course.

​

Everyday, despite wanting to live (something I will never stop doing regardless of the thoughts of death being easy) I think often about what I wish I had. I think about committing myself to my goals and aspirations but day after day, I let my problems manifest into an excuse.

I have done skydiving and ""normal"" diving. I have played video and board games. I have practiced martial arts and played hockey. I've done close up magic. I have watched a lots of movies, animes and read comics. I have studied architecture, history and art. I have travelled to 94 different countries. I have tried gardening. I served in the army. I have built computers. I have driven and built motorcycles and sportcars for fun and on the track. I've done locksport. I used to read a lot. I have collected watches and studied horology.

With my relationship she’s in college about four hours away. I use to be overbearing and always wanting to see my gf and be around them. With this girl I since backed up and let her have a life. I sacrifice some of my time just to see her &amp; make sure she’s happy. But I still feel like I’m failing as a boyfriend. 
I don’t know what to do. All I ever asked for is for her to be able to have a conversation with me, listen to and talk with me about my problems, don’t lie to me, and put some effort into us. It’s like she gives up so fast when we argue and quick to leave the convo and go hours without talking instead of trying to talk the situation out. Maybe it’s me, maybe I’m not satisfying her or something. 
She’s a nice girl and good girlfriend. We’ve been together for a good 1 and 3 months now. I know I have high standards but I lowered them just for her so we can see eye to eye. She’s four hours away and when she do come back down here she’s always to busy for me. When I do see her it’s only a few hours here and there. Maybe I’m thinking to much into it. 

And now she’s just now gotten into church and she once said “our relationship isn’t pleasing to god”. It’s not like I don’t believe in god. I just avoid going to church cause the times that I have went to church I always got shunned away. So I avoid to go and just learn on my own. We also have sex before marriage and she wants to stop which is fine but she didn’t even talk to me about it first.
Maybe I’m not meant to be loved. If a girl who I gave everything too and even helped pay for some of her college bills can’t give me the simple things &amp; my own mom leaving me. I’m just not meant to be loved. I failed as a son and boyfriend.

And most of us, both by action and by statement of our behavior, all tend to show up on time. 

So, the eight of us had decided to come to my place at bla time. 1,5 hour earlier, i get a message from A that they are going to be late with like an hour/maybe closer to two, but they would show up if we were still hanging. That's great, then i know! 

The clock is ticking, when the time for when we are supposed to meet strikes, I am snapchatting (only pictures, no text) with B, and since I see them not leaving their home I ask them when they are coming. B tells me they feel really bad because it's the time of year their grandfather passed away. Ok, maybe in the latest minute to inform me, but I'm okay with that because I understand they felt bad and maybe couldn't gather the energy to inform me. 

A few minutes later, C and D inform me they are just going to get a quick lunch and then come over (at the time I thought they were just going to pick up lunch and bring it to my place). Time keeps ticking, noone shows up. Friend E doesn't say anything about coming or not coming, but I didn't ask because we had set the time and place, and I don't want to hound them. But I'm sitting there and no one's there yet. So 20 min later, I'm feeling like this is not going to happen (I know, 20 min is not that much really, but in a friend group were everyone is at latest 10 min late at worst... Yeah.) By now I'm pretty sure E has totally forgot it, cause they seem to still be in the town over (snapchat-map is stalker-map). 

40 min after we are supposed to meet, F calls me. 
“Whats happenin?”
“Nothing, cause no one is here…” and then i continue to explain why noone is there. Friend F are apparently with C and D in town and eating lunch. I had forgotten that F was meeting C earlier for stuff, and D lives in the same building as C so they left for lunch together. And about there the call ends. They did not ask me to come out to them (nothing more than 5-10 min walk) even though they now knew I’m sitting alone, when they were supposed to be there. And they had ditched me for lunch and didn’t ask me to join when they learned I was stood up by kind of EVERYONE.

5 min later same person text me saying it’s better we cancels the hanging at my place. And mentally I’m like, no bloody shit Sherlock, I had that figured by like 15 min after noone showed because I know how we work.

And F was at the time with A and B, my closest friends in the area. They didn’t write or call me that they were going to be late personally, they just called 40 min later and then cancelled the entire thing probably because they felt like they had hung out enough with C and D, and hanging out with me was to much of a hassle or something...

And at that point i just was so frustrated and disappointed, 7 friends was supposed to come over. But I’m dissed by 4 of them, and 1 is feeling to ill to come and 1 is not sure if they will make it here! I didn’t exactly feel valued as a friend...

Eventually A came over, (1,5 hours later) they had missed my message about the hanging not happening and noone showing up. I got to vent and after hanging for some time with A felt better.

TL;DR 
I read a few comments in a thread talking about friends being late without telling you, and couldn’t stop thinking about this, were the biggest hurt was caused one of my closest friends in the area at the time (that later friendship-broke up with me, hence the bigger frustration then necessary for the situation today).

I read a few comments in a thread talking about friends being late without telling you, and couldn’t stop thinking about this, were the biggest hurt was caused one of my closest friends in the area at the time (that later friendship-broke up with me, hence the bigger frustration then necessary for the situation today). I and 7 friends decided to meet at my place, only 1 showed up.&lt;/p&gt;

Its a warm, pleasant day, customers might come in any moment, and I am anticipating that. And who walks through the door? The mother of the woman who very nearly completely destroyed my ability to feel feelings. 

 Without going into a whole bunch of historical information, none of which I actually want to dig through to recount right now, the woman I am referring to, chose a person convicted of possessing indecent images of children, over me. I gave her an ultimatum, saying its either me or him, and she chose him. She chose a sicko, a pervert, a fucking degenerate, over me, and though I know I am far from perfect, I did NOT deserve that. I can think of few things in my whole life, that have been as damned near to destroying even the healthiest parts of my ego, as that was. She and I had been sharing a bed regularly for five years or so at that point. I could have dealt with the lack of exclusivity (I wasn't the only one, and that was all understood before I began my association with her), I could have dealt with all the other things that were insane about that woman, and kept doing it all the rest of my life, but she took up with a pervert, I called her on it, and she ditched me like a gum wrapper. 

 I carried that woman home from bars when the cabs refused to take her, because she had managed to puke on herself after drinking too much. I helped her gut and redecorate her house, I watched over her when she was in danger of self harming, cleaned up when she did hurt herself, and stopped her when I caught her trying to. I could have dealt with all the out workings of the damage caused to her by having a mother who is intensely damaged herself, and I would have helped with all of that. I accepted things I did not like about the situation between me and her, namely the lack of exclusivity, all because life with her in it was better than life without, no matter how hard it might have been. And she chose scum over me. Scum who had never done anything for her, and, just in case it was not clear, is SCUM. 

 And her mother wants to come into my store, and tell me about how the family is? Here is what I felt like saying:

 Well, madam, I don't care that your other, younger daughter is now pregnant with her boyfriends child, and I do not care that the foul, degenerate she cunt you birthed first is having money troubles, has learned to drive, or any other bloody thing that you have to say, because if the lot of you became on fire all of a sudden, I would not even call the authorities. I would laugh until I were sure you were dead, light a cigarette off your burning carcass, and merrily carry on my day, you fuck. 

 Of course I did not say all those things, because I am a gentleman. That also pisses me off. But neither thing pisses me off as much as the fact that these things CAN still piss me off.

A lot of leftover stress and anxiety, but also a lot of really good, proud-of-myself feelings. So, here you go.

My old boss at the University I work for was a total DICKWAD and made me feel like complete crap for even the smallest mistakes, things that should have been expected for someone who hadn't even worked there a full year, but instead he just came at me and made me feel totally worthless. I'm pretty smart, I'm a fast learner, I don't make a TON of mistakes in my work. Not at all saying I'm perfect, but I just do good work, especially once I know exactly what I'm doing. Mistakes are few and far between, and I constantly try to do better. But this guy just had it out for me, and would focus on the smallest things, like a mismarked spreadsheet or not having 15 full days of sick time saved up (I have migraines, that I have FMLA for, and he was still pissed that I wasn't able to save up sick and vacation time). He refused to even give me 2 hours of vacation time, when requested over 2 weeks in advance, because I did not have 15 full days of time saved up. (for reference, it will take me 1.5 years without taking one hour of vacation to save up 15 days with the way I accrue it. So he was essentially denying any vacation for 1.5 years). If I had been smart, I would have kept record of all this and the Union would have had a field day. But I'm a moron and didn't do that until it was too late.

So anyway, I took the first job that came my way within the university, which was also one I had had my eye on for a while. When I left the old job, my boss told me I would not be successful in anything I did (I was 23 at the time, 24 now). I'm a young woman doing her best to pursue a career at her university, in spite of no college education, and he flat out told me I would not be successful. Dick.

The new boss hired me without even an interview, because I had worked with her in the past and she thought I did an excellent job and wanted me on her staff as soon as possible.

I've been here for 7 months now, *aced* every review I've had, and my new boss adores me. She says I am a fabulous worker, and she is so glad she got me on her staff.

I am the senior most front office staff worker (meaning I am stationed in the front office, my job is as a fiscal admin), and even though I've only been here a few months, I have made myself a resource and the ""go-to"" when something needs resolved, or if someone needs help. I am over 3 other front office workers, and I am flourishing. My migraines are down to 2-3 a month, instead of 2 a week, all of my coworkers enjoy working with me, and they all rely on me for a number of things.

One of the things that my old boss cited as a reason to hate me is because I had not made myself a ""go to"" for anything. But I have to laugh, because even now, 7 months later, I ***still*** get emails about the jobs I used to do in my old position. Still. And I am 100% the ""go to"" in my new office.

I have a ton of flexibility in this new position, even allowing me to work from home when I am too sick to come in but not sick enough to sleep all day (like, I got a nasty cold this weekend and was mostly better by Monday, but still sounded disgusting and wasn't at 100%, so they let me take my financial paperwork home and work from home just because they're awesome). I love it out here, I'm doing really well, and it came with a significant pay raise.

My new boss genuinely wants us all to succeed, and she builds all of us up as best as she can, and she is incredible.

So it feels really FUCKING good to know that it wasn't me, it was my old boss who was an ass, and really FUCKING good to prove him wrong.

Im a young guy, and I fancied a young lady.  She was soon leaving town though, so oh well.  However, about 1-2 weeks before she left, she recovered some half wild kittens that a tomcat made with her dads outdoor farm cat.  

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I would help be alleviating 1 cat.  I'd never been a cat guy, but the kittens were adorable and guys will do stupid things for girls.  

&amp;#x200B;

Something to know about these cats, is due to their first four weeks or so out in the wild, they were not normally behaved cats.  They were extremely shy, skiddish even, around humans.  They were nearly feral.  She had, I think four.  At least two were greyish in color, another one maybe grey, or real dark.  Then there was a runt, calico.  I thought one of the greyest, a female kitten, was cutesy so I grabbed her.  As I was in my car leaving, she calls out to me from her balcony; her cousin who was taking the grey brother cat who paired mine, could no longer take him.  So I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys will do stupid things for girls.   And they were a pair and I didn't want to separate them (the boy was already spoken for, so I didnt want her to not feel left out.  I don't know, I was dumb).  I then regret not taking the runt.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I've got these two terrified demons in my basement.  My basement is in disrepair.  Cluttered with tons of my parents junk.  That's a post for another day.  But all of this clutter makes for perfect kitten hiding spaces.  I dont think I made contact with my cats for the first week of having them.  Slowly they began to open up to me.  I tried my hardest to form a bond with these cats because I felt bad for them.   They were some how already miraculously litter trained, before my friend even gave them to me.  She had them for maybe a week, and either it was because they were already a few weeks old or something, but they just knew to use the litter box.  

&amp;#x200B;

So taking care of them early was easy, just put food and water out for them, change the litter.  Couldn't interact with them.  As the days went by, we'd cuddle a lot, and play around, theyd chase their toys.  It was great.  They would crawl on me, but didnt so much enjoy being picked up.  I still bear scars.  They loved coming to me for attention, but quickly learn to evade me if I was looking for them.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks in though and I needed to take them to the vet.  The moment they knew I was looking actively for theyd go into hiding.   This meant I had to resort to trickery and trapping.  I'd become proficient at this in the coming months as I would need to take them to more vet appointments.  At the vet, they would always be in distress.  They were not comfortable outside of my house.  They were afraid to go outside.  I could not get them to cross the barrier of that which is my door to the outside world.  If I tried to carry them out, they would claw at me in a fury in order to get down and back inside.  All completely warrantless.  So getting them to the vet was a pain. After I felt my annual vet check ups weren't worth my vet subscription I cancelled it.  I couldn't stand hearing to distress my cats like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to four exact years later, 2019.  My girlfriend (we got together just a couple months after I got the cats) and I are watching Game of Thrones.  The first night, my complete fault.  I'd put off changing their litter box.  The cats pissed all over the couch we were on.  So I cleaned everything up, gave their box a deep cleaning, everything is square.   I'm Johnny on the spot with their box from here out.

&amp;#x200B;

Every week it continues.  My girlfriend already hates my cats.  She's hated them for a long time.  By the way, i just want to add, they never showed any signs of being territorial until about 2 years into my relationship when we introduced a third cat to foster for a friend of my girlfriend's.  

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend never gave me an ultimatum.  She never told me to get rid of my cats.  But I knew it's what she wanted.  She'd already expressed her contempt towards the cats with me plenty of times.  So when GoT finished, and my couches soiled, I knew what I had to do.  I called the humane society.  

&amp;#x200B;

It broke my heart. I dont even want to describe the process I had to go through getting them kennelled up.  If I could remember the worse trauma theyd been through before trying to go to the vet, this was 10 times worse.  It took me a full hour to grab them both.  By the end of it they were panting, scared, yelping, crying, extreme distress.  I was bawling my eyes out.

&amp;#x200B;

 These cats were like my babies.  They were young, angsty, weirdo cats, but they were special.  I dont really think they'll be picked up by a family that want to deal with them.  I cant even imagine what my cats are going through.  I signed up for what I believe is receiving a notice of them being rehomed, and it's been a month and I havent heard anything.  All I can hear in my hear is the girl cat crying.  The only thing that gives me any solace, is that if I haven't been notified at all yet, at least they should still have each other","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s rewind to spring 2015.

Today he noticed I got a haircut from yesterday that I didn’t think was that noticeable. It was just a trim. But the fact he noticed that little thing about me made me happy. He brought up the fact that we still need to go out and grab a drink sometime but I was in a rush and left without replying to him. I intended on giving him an answer but I didn’t see him after that. I usually see him a lot but today I didn’t and I think that’s why I’m feeling this way right now.

If anyone knows someone working for Adobe in the financial department or whatever ask them WHY THEY ARE SCREWING OVER STUDENTS WITH THE CANCELLATION FEE! Just have to where we use it for a certain amount of time! It&amp;#39;s absolutely frustrating!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a 23 year old male. My mom has been a stay at home mom since my birth. Her devotion to our family life has been incredible, and I am eternally grateful for the sacrifices she made.

My sisters and I are all in our twenties, and we are all going to college. Now, my mom stays alone most of the day. Let's say our lives are very different from what they were years ago. Thing is, my mother's role remains unchanged. I'm at the age where I do my own laundry, wash my own dishes (I had to push to be allowed to do these things) etc... So most of the things she was doing for me as a kid, I am now doing for myself, whether she likes it or not (this is not the case for my sisters though) . 

Given these changes and the changes to come (us starting our lives), I am very concerned about what her life will be like, emotionally and financially. Most of the times when I see her, she is browsing Facebook on the couch or complaining about how she is tired of cooking. When I ask he if she is looking for hobbies or taking up a part-time job, I am met with a ""I am perfectly happy here"". This does not ease my concerns at all, and actually confuses me. 

I feel helpless in this situation, and I often feel guilty at the though of leaving home, and thus, leaving her alone.

I am not expecting a specific answer, I just don't want to burden my friends or relatives with these strange concerns.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I wish you all a good day :)

She said she wasn’t looking for anything  either and was just looking at her options. 
This past fathers days and she offers to take me out for a drink, a nice gesture i thought, then a couple of her friends show up (both guys) one I know, and the other I don’t, I don’t think anything of it and we have a drink and a chat and eventually go home.

I can’t seem to continue to hide how I feel about it and I’m afraid she’s going to ask and i’m going to break into a tirade of how much I love her and how my hopes are dashed. But I realise this is my problem, not hers, I have no right to rain on her parade with my issues.

I can’t seem to continue to hide how I feel about it and I’m afraid she’s going to ask and i’m going to break into a tirade of how much I love her and how my hopes are dashed. But I realise this is my problem, not hers, I have no right to rain on her parade with my issues. 
I want her to be happy even if it makes me miserable but I’m having a hard time coping with being miserable hence this post.&lt;/p&gt;

So last year, it was my birthday (it's next monday if you want to send good vibes my way.) and it was... disappointing. 

So disappointing in fact that past me from last year sent me an E-mail from the future to remind myself I ought not to expect a thing from my dad. 

And it brought back a lot of bagage I had burried : 

Last year, my dad sent me a message inviting me to come over his house for the weekend of my 23rd birthday. He told me we would go and eat something at a restaurant with my brother, my grandmother and maybe my uncle's family. 

All this if you remember correctly occured during the world cup. 

At the time I was working in a bookstore in another town. My shift ended at 7pm on a saturday. So after commuting by train back to my hometown, his wife came to pick me up and told me : 

\- We would leave together at the moment we get home to go to a restaurant

 \- It would only be my stepmother (I ain't calling her that no more, i'll call her Val), her demon spawn daughter (which won't be mentionned again) and my brother (from whom I never expect anything). no uncle, no grandmother... just my brother, my dad, Val and her daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok.... It was fricking hot in my country. I was covered in sweat, tired etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

And when we got Home I met my dad who was sitting on his ass watching the world cup. This was why he sent his wife fetch me. to watch a fucking football match. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to the restaurant, I wanted to order a pizza but they only had burgers (a bit annoying but fine nonetheless. I kept on eyeing my dad... expecting a gift, any proof to acknowledge that it indeed was my birthday we were celebrating. but by the end of the night. No thing. 

Oh-ok then maybe They would give it to me the next day you know ? on my actual birthday. 

In the morning I went down to greet everyone. My dad had left to walk his dog, Val was eating breakfast. 

She then told me that they would be going to her aunt's house and that If I wanted I could stay home. 

""All right I said"" and I went back upstairs and decided to spend my birthday. tensed as a bow because My dad made me cancel any plan I could have had for my own birthday with my actual friends to go to a fucking restaurant and that's about it. 

No cake, no gift, no family reunion, no other surprise than the disappointing looming voice in the back of my head yelling ""I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO."" 

....

I cried when I got back to my mom's. I was so angry at my dad for this. It may sound childish but, for most of my childhood, I was away from my parents for my birthdays (Scout camps in the country). I never had the opportunity to host an awesome birthday party with my friends because they all went on vacation at this time of the year. 

I did not enjoy spending my Eighteenth birthday getting yelled at because I was not acting responsible enough

I did not enjoy spending my sixteenth birthday having to walk 30 kilometers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was so sad... depressed, it felt like I was not being rewarded for all the wins I received that year. (I got my degree found a job without anyone's help. 

But feeling left ouf after this left me feeling like a worthless, unwanted piece of shit. 

So I wrote myself a letter telling me to lower the fuck of my expectation about my dad. And It's probably the best idea I had that month (I burned my hand trying to pry open a beer a few weeks later) because. a few days ago : my dad invited me to his house next sunday : he'll invite my grandmother, my uncle, my brother... All the red flags are here. And I had totally forgotten about this until now. 

I was ready for a big surprise but now I'm ready to be disappointed. 

But still... i needed to let it out of my head.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;/p&gt;

We were madly in love. Made each other better, stronger, communicated well. Or so I thought. I knew like most people, we had our problems. Insecurities, jealousy, things I thought we could overcome. I also thought his sobriety would last longer. I'm not an idiot, I know it's a struggle daily. But I also thought maybe his child would give him more of a reason to stay sober. When in fact, quite the opposite. Repressed memories from his childhood came back out when he married me and fathered our child. His therapist said he was delusional and dissociative to reality and his repressed memories were all convoluted. He had a mental break down. No doubt he has mental issues going on. But worse part of it, he was manipulating me the entire time. I tried to leave him when he got drunk and threatened me, taunted me, trying to provoke me to hit him. I didn't. Instead I called the cops on him. I tried to leave, but his mother used me as a bargaining chip to stay after his attempt to suicide. He then gets treatment. Comes out even more angry and now drinking on psych meds. I end up taking him to the hospital, but its pouring rain and I have a baby in the car with no blanket, no umbrella... so I tell him to check himself in and tell them about the mix of alcohol and psych meds. He told them he drank too much. So they send him away, tell him to walk home. He gets picked up by the cops and held in the drunk tank. The next day I am packing my things to leave him. In the process of doing so, he ends up belligerent drunk (again on meds) and screaming at me that it's my fault he got arrested. Threatens me again and charges at me. I call the cops again. He gets treatment again. Things seem up and down for a bit. But then, a complete change in his behavior again. He created a false reality again. Screaming at me for things I havent done. This time he is threatening to take our son, ""you can fucking leave me, but you won't be taking MY son."" ""I am not keeping our son from you. I go to the house, you come to my parents. I stay, you stay. Almost every day. But you are on these new drugs and sleep 12 hrs at a time and don't hear the doorbell, the phone, your alarms...not even when our son was screaming at you to wake up. It's not safe."" ""So what...?

I also thought his sobriety would last longer. I&amp;#39;m not an idiot, I know it&amp;#39;s a struggle daily. But I also thought maybe his child would give him more of a reason to stay sober. When in fact, quite the opposite. Repressed memories from his childhood came back out when he married me and fathered our child. His therapist said he was delusional and dissociative to reality and his repressed memories were all convoluted. He had a mental break down. No doubt he has mental issues going on. But worse part of it, he was manipulating me the entire time. I tried to leave him when he got drunk and threatened me, taunted me, trying to provoke me to hit him. I didn&amp;#39;t. Instead I called the cops on him. I tried to leave, but his mother used me as a bargaining chip to stay after his attempt to suicide. He then gets treatment. Comes out even more angry and now drinking on psych meds. I end up taking him to the hospital, but its pouring rain and I have a baby in the car with no blanket, no umbrella... so I tell him to check himself in and tell them about the mix of alcohol and psych meds. He told them he drank too much. So they send him away, tell him to walk home. He gets picked up by the cops and held in the drunk tank. The next day I am packing my things to leave him. In the process of doing so, he ends up belligerent drunk (again on meds) and screaming at me that it&amp;#39;s my fault he got arrested. Threatens me again and charges at me. I call the cops again. He gets treatment again. Things seem up and down for a bit. But then, a complete change in his behavior again. He created a false reality again. Screaming at me for things I havent done. This time he is threatening to take our son, &amp;quot;you can fucking leave me, but you won&amp;#39;t be taking MY son.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I am not keeping our son from you. I go to the house, you come to my parents. I stay, you stay. Almost every day. But you are on these new drugs and sleep 12 hrs at a time and don&amp;#39;t hear the doorbell, the phone, your alarms...not even when our son was screaming at you to wake up. It&amp;#39;s not safe.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;So what...? I&amp;#39;m a danger to you and MY son?!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;YES! You are unstable and unpredictable. If you don&amp;#39;t calm down and let go of our son I WILL call the cops.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Call the fucking cops.&amp;quot; And so I did.&lt;/p&gt;

Talking of friends. These guys don't ever talk to me unless they need something. I don't even have anyone I can turn to to vent (hence doing it here).

I'm on mobile so sorry for the formatting.

    So, for the sake of the story, well call this friend B. B is your typical ""weird kid"" that you have in every school. Plays computer games, enjoys anything but sports, ect. Because of this we both met in 1st grade and the friendship stuck until now. Now that your background info is here, I'll get to the main point. 

    In 7th grade, I moved long distance away from my hometown, but me and B were able to talk and play games through steam and discord. We even had another friend, M, who joined on to.  Everything was going great...
     Until B had a sudden change. B decided that he had control over the group we had. Okay. He named me another friend, Y, some creative names about how we sucked. Ya know, it wasn't that bad. Telling us we sucked, in the beginning, it wasn't that bad. Then it kept happening, over and over and over and over. He brought the joke through discord and ended up taking it with M also. Okay, I'm fine with that. It's just a joke. Until it poured into everything. Every game we played, any interaction we had. "" You suck because _____"" or whatever could make me angry was said. Anytime I didn't talk to him that day I needed a reason, and if it wasn't good enough, I would get blamed when I joined the next call. But skipping over the major event that ticked me off wouldn't do the story service.

    Near February of this year, I joined a server that M ran, with B and other mutual friends in the group. We're all playing around with the bots, having a decent time. Then, the jokes started pouring out again. It was about this time I was getting very pissy about the joke because it was overused to all hell and I was sick of hearing it every single day for a year. After telling them to stop saying for like 2 months every single day and them saying ""just don't suck"", M had the greatest idea. He named me a, very offensive word tied to the sexuality of a person. This is important because I had told them I was bisexual at the time, and they used that to fuel their joke. I was done with them and done with their joke. So around February, I decided to block them everywhere and leave the group behind. It was actually really hard because, despite the fact their huge dicks, we were close and I told them about myself as a person.

    Well, even with me leaving them, loneliness got me. Sure, I had friends at school and was even starting a relationship with my bf, I was lonely after school. Around the time my summer let out, my bf wasn't an option to talk to anymore (I would share details but the story is two long already) and so I decided to unblock them and talk to them. When I came back, around a month ago, they were actually really nice, but most likely because I left, but they were nice. When I vented to M about not being able to talk to my bf, he actually listened and didn't criticize me over it. It was really refreshing. But B didn't exactly help me with my opinion on the matter. He told me basically that I should deal with it and it sucks to sucks. THANKS...
     
     So now, I'm here. It's 4 in the morning and I'm venting on a throwaway about how my friends were assholes and how one still is. Btw, Y didn't speak up because Y also dealt with the assholery too. But, it's fine rn. I just needed to get all that off my chest. If you want to call me petty or a snowflake, do it. If you want it call me good for taking action, do it. Thanks for listening!

EDIT - There is probably some left out info that I can't think off. If you ask, I'll answer.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using a throwaway because the people in this story probably have my Reddit account. I&amp;#39;m on mobile so sorry for the formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;So, for the sake of the story, well call this friend B. B is your typical &amp;quot;weird kid&amp;quot; that you have in every school. Plays computer games, enjoys anything but sports, ect. Because of this we both met in 1st grade and the friendship stuck until now. Now that your background info is here, I&amp;#39;ll get to the main point. 

In 7th grade, I moved long distance away from my hometown, but me and B were able to talk and play games through steam and discord. We even had another friend, M, who joined on to.  Everything was going great...
 Until B had a sudden change. B decided that he had control over the group we had. Okay. He named me another friend, Y, some creative names about how we sucked. Ya know, it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. Telling us we sucked, in the beginning, it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. Then it kept happening, over and over and over and over. He brought the joke through discord and ended up taking it with M also. Okay, I&amp;#39;m fine with that. It&amp;#39;s just a joke. Until it poured into everything. Every game we played, any interaction we had. &amp;quot; You suck because _____&amp;quot; or whatever could make me angry was said. Anytime I didn&amp;#39;t talk to him that day I needed a reason, and if it wasn&amp;#39;t good enough, I would get blamed when I joined the next call. But skipping over the major event that ticked me off wouldn&amp;#39;t do the story service.

Near February of this year, I joined a server that M ran, with B and other mutual friends in the group. We&amp;#39;re all playing around with the bots, having a decent time. Then, the jokes started pouring out again. It was about this time I was getting very pissy about the joke because it was overused to all hell and I was sick of hearing it every single day for a year. After telling them to stop saying for like 2 months every single day and them saying &amp;quot;just don&amp;#39;t suck&amp;quot;, M had the greatest idea. He named me a, very offensive word tied to the sexuality of a person. This is important because I had told them I was bisexual at the time, and they used that to fuel their joke. I was done with them and done with their joke. So around February, I decided to block them everywhere and leave the group behind.

I think i&amp;#39;m gonna have to repeat 10th grade and it really fucking bothers me and i&amp;#39;ve been really sad.( I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s just sadness anymore tbh but i don&amp;#39;t wanna diagnose myself so i just say that i&amp;#39;m sad.) Anyways, i tried to tell her about whats going on inside my head but she just like didn&amp;#39;t even try to like cheer me up or something. She said one thing and then just like sighed and rolled her eyes and then immediately talked about herself and a guy she&amp;#39;s talking to. The funny part is that when shes upset i always give my best trying to comfort her and to be there for her but apparently i&amp;#39;m not as important to her as she&amp;#39;s to me. She also critizises  me a lot or she picks on me a lot. She says  things like :&amp;quot; if i were your teacher, i would give you another grade bc like you didn&amp;#39;t really deserve that grade&amp;quot;, and she also made and still makes  fun of my F in math idk why she finds it so funny. One time in her snapchat story she named a couple of people &amp;quot;who helped her through bad situations and were there for her&amp;quot; but she didn&amp;#39;t name me even tho i&amp;#39;ve always been there for her even if i had my own shit to deal with. It just fucking sucks that nothing u do is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago, the bosses called the heads of departments for a meeting on site to tell us the business is ""transferring"" or ""merging"" with another company. Pretty much this one is being sold to someone else who is interested in continuing the model that we have. Currently, they may be interested in taking SOME staff with them. They have not yet decided. Though we've asked for more information, there is no update if they have decided to take staff, if we can work remotely if they do, where the main office will be...nothing. Except: ""Everything is moving faster than we anticipated."" Any day can be our last.

&amp;#x200B;

And what ticked me off, what really set my anger once everything hit: They've been debating to sell and talking with buyers since MARCH. That's why everything started to slow down. We were asking legitimate questions over the last few months: Why is it so hard to get product in, are we running anymore e-mail promos, anything we can do to help business increase. There were workers willing to drive around the city with the company logo on their vehicles. All we got was ""No, no, we're okay. Just growing pains. Things will get better.""To everything, you said ""No, it's okay. It's just growing pains."" Talking about slowly increasing volume again. And as worried as we were then, we believed and trusted. We actually got excited when the volume picked up just a bit. Then to be met with ""Yeah, actually.....""

&amp;#x200B;

What we would have appreciated instead of the lies and false reassurance were REAL SOLID ANSWERS. Nearly every one of us have worked here since the start. Some VERBAL WARNING would have been nice so that we're not suddenly in this limbo or scrambling to find a new job, telling OUR OWN STAFF instead of holding a company wide meeting to discuss together.  


And it's not like we can go and get unemployment if they do not decide to hire us. We're marked as ""independent contractors."" None of us quality, due to being ""self employed."" I checked. Our state does not offer benefits to ""independent contractors."" So all those talks about starting Pay Roll were lies, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I know not a single company is legally required to say or do anything. They can do whatever they want, whenever they want. And I get it, they likely don't want staff to suddenly start leaving due to ""company hardships,"" but c'mon.

First off, I am terrified of being sick. Like panic attack terrified. Second, I NEVER take OTC pain meds unless I absolutely have to. There are a lot of reasons for this but primarily it is because meds tend to do weird, unpredictable things to my emotions so I will live through the pain rather than take pain meds unless absolutely necessary.

So it is a long story but nearly two weeks ago I started developing a rash on my palms. I had been working in the garden the day before So I assumed it was just a minor allergy. It didn’t hurt or itch so I ignored it. The next day the rash has spread up my arms. Still no itch/pain so I just ignored it. When it didn’t go away I broke down and took Benadryl. It didn’t help at all and I had a ridiculous amount of energy from the med that was supposed to put me to sleep. As the day went on though, I began to hurt a bit and then my teeth started chattering. I had a fever over 101. My husband took me to the ER (it was Saturday so only option) because we thought I was having a severe allergic reaction and I could start going into anaphylaxis.

ER gives me Benadryl which does nothing for the rash. They tell me it looks like I may have gotten a disease from a tick bite but I had no tick bites. They said call the doc on Monday and prescribed me 10 days of antibiotics. 

Sunday, I wake up and the rash is now on the bottom of my feet, which does hurt when I walk, and spreading up my legs. Also my joints start aching a little. I lay on the couch all day. Then Sunday night I can’t sleep, the joint pain is so bad I can’t pull the sheet over myself or get up and walk to the bathroom. 230 am my DH takes me back to the ER (after having to dress me and buckle me into the car because I couldn’t do it myself). The ER scratches their heads, gives me a steroid shot and tells me to see the doctor Monday. They offer me Dilauded but I declined because the last time I took something like that I punched my mom in the face.   The rash is now all red and blotchy, my hands are swollen, my toes are swollen, and I can’t make a fist because my joints won’t do it.

Monday finally comes and I see a dermatologist. He says “you have a virus”, does a biopsy and tells me to take ibuprofen for the pain. He says it will go away, I am not contagious and it is all fine. 

That was over a week ago. The biopsy came back and the doctor said “well it is probably a virus” which means he has no fucking clue what it is, only what it isn’t. I still have joint pain every morning when I wake up. The rash is fading but now the skin around my fingers is peeling. The last two days I have had a low grade fever (which is a big deal for me because I take my temp a lot [because of my phobia] and my temp is never over 98.4) and have been so lethargic that I can’t do anything for any length of time. 

I am scared that something is really wrong with me. My mom has rheumatoid arthritis and my symptoms are a lot like hers. I don’t want to have RA. I weave, crochet and spin yarn. I NEED my hands. I am scared that I am going to lose them. I am scared that I don’t have a virus and whatever I am fighting has gone on too long and I will have lasting effects. I am scared that if it is a virus I could still be contagious and I could infect my niece and nephew. I am scared because I am sick and I don’t know why. 

My family has been incredibly supportive but I am sick of hearing “it will be fine”. I have never had a problem bouncing back from illness/pain in my life. This is like my worst fear and I have been living it for almost 2 weeks (amazingly without completely breaking down until right now). 

I have an appointment with my regular doctor tomorrow and I know she will help me figure this out but right now I am just scared, annoyed and I want this to go away!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This got long, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

My mom was raised in a conservative family so talking about sex, menstrual cycles, and domestic agruments are supposed to be kept to yourself. Anyways she never talked to me about sex, boyfriends, periods or 'womenhood' at all. I learned everything either from school, friends, or online.

One of her biggest problems are ... Wait for it......pads! No, not used ones. Brand new ones still wrapped and in the box. Let me explain.

When I was younger my periods would be irregular and as a result I would never know when it'd come, so as a precaution I'd leave the package of pads underneath the cabinet sink. My mom would legit take them out and hide them inside my underwear drawer. She would then tell me, that my older brother and dad didn't need to see my dirty things. And being a teen I took it to heart, I began to be ashamed of myself and my body, it lasted until 7th grade. When all the girls were given 'the talk', the PE teacher did something amazing. She took out a pad and held it to the sky, then wrapped it and stuck it to her forehead. She told us that it happens to everyone and that we shouldn't be shamed. One of the girls asked her if she ment it, she stood up and said 'I'll walk out right now with this still on my head and I would not give a shit.' I realised that I was being ashamed of something so natural. So I went home and placed my pads underneath the sink, and continued to do it every single time she took them out. Today my period arrived and I looked under the sink, my box with the pads were gone. I called my mom and confronted her about it she said, ""he (her boyfriend) doesn't need to know about your thing."" 

I was SO MAD!

Next to our house there’s this garage and a strip of land behind. The guy who lives across the road from us, who I’ll call Sam, owns this strip of land.

I have lived in this house for 10 years (since I was 4) and have grown up here. Sam doesn’t use the strip of land behind the garage so my dad pays to use it every year. This strip of land gives us the room to have our vegetable patches, slide/swings combo, the normal things in a family back garden.

Now there’s a fence running along part of the way down the garden with really pretty ivy on it to act as a natural screening of sorts. Sam recently decided to move out and move somewhere. As he’s selling the house and this strip is still technically his land, he decided to remove the ivy (without telling us) the day we have people over. The fence looks really, REALLY shoddy so my mum and dad were pretty pissed that he wouldn’t tell us. He offered to pay for new screening so all good right?

Nope.

Sam put a letter through our door yesterday basically saying fuck you. He’s decided to fence off that strip of land. We have 1-2 days to remove EVERYTHING on that side of the fence, he’s not going to pay for screening, we have to let random people walk in and out of our garden as they build and measure up the fence which is going to be very noisy. It’s going to last for weeks and they’ll even work on weekends in the middle of summer. Now I like my morning lie-ins as much as everyone but having to wake up every morning at 6:00 to get to school and then be woken up at 8am on weekends doesn’t exactly sound the funnest thing in the world. Also, if we want any screening to cover that fence, we have to build another fence right beside it as he told us we aren’t allowed to attach anything to the fence or garage.

Anyway onto the reason I’m writing this 

She is a stoner she can’t go without weed or she’ll just break down into tears she sticks with her close group of stoner friends I’ve met most of her closest ones and they’re all great people 

She’s always been a fly under the radar type of person

HERES WHERE I GET WORRIED 

She dated a junior as a freshman already kinda sketch but whatever 3 months go by and he’s given up on the relationship but she’s too scared to let go of people that she loves. He dumps her over text in class the day before Valentine’s Day 
She was fucking destroyed 
This is where it starts to get a little bit sketchy with her not being the same person I met a year ago
About 3 weeks after they break up she does just about the dumbest thing she could have done. 1 it’s already bad enough they dated because her Ex was my sisters best friend and her ex my sister and his friend were all really close so I “know” him pretty decently but I also know his friend her ex knows I had feelings for her but what she does couldn’t be worse 

After about 3 weeks after they broke up she and her ex’s friend were hanging out keep in mind that her ex’s friend is a well know douchebag and I know this because he cheated on my sister and he is know for using girls to fuck. They get stoned together and fuck 
WHAT?!?!?!?!?! 
WHY 
OUT 
OF 
ALL 
PEOPLE
First Of all he’s a massive prick to everyone except freshmen girls...
She is best friends with douches ex 
Douche is best friends with her ex
Douche is a douche and is just pretty gross too
I used to know both of them decently 
She was never one to fuck people let alone douche 
And I realllllly don’t get why out of all things they would fuck?!?!?!?

Anyway time passes me and her are still good friends but I’m noticing that something doesn’t  feel the same as it used to between us 

Time passes and she’s talking about how these drug dealers are trying to flirt with her 
She says she’s gonna hang out with one of them in a few weeks she insists that she’s only doing it to get smoked up for free 
She gets back and says that she hates him and how he’s a white guy who acts black and how he’s a dick
Next thing you know they’re hanging out every weekend 

You know what fine go ahead if he’s your friend go hang out with him whatever but I was still hella sus about this guy

I went on vacation for about a week and I call her she’s so excited to see me can’t wait to tell you all about everything that’s happened etc...

While I was gone she hang out with that drug dealer guy at the local park with his friends until 6:00 am and had to run from the cops 

I was mad at her but I still wanted to talk to her more than anything 

She says she’ll call me when she gets home wait and wait for a call never get one ask where she is 
She’s at the drug dealer guys house and she was gonna hang out with him 
 
Jesus Christ I’ve waited to talk to you for a week and now I gotta wait another day fuck you too

And now to present day 

EVERY TIME IVE TRIED TO TALK TO HER SHES LEFT ME ON READ EVERY TIME I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING WRONG 

now she’s posting more and more revealing pictures on her story and insta and she’s becoming more and more of a hoe and it’s making me so fucking worried because I’ve sunk so much time into this person and I don’t want to lose her I don’t want to see her go down a path of being a druggie whore bit I don’t know how to try to help her if she won’t even talk to me we used to talk every day nonstop 24/7 bout everything that came to mind but now I’m not even an option??? Like I don’t know how I can unfuck this situation she’s my best friend and I can’t afford to lose her and I’m afraid if I slip up I’m gonna cause a problem and drive her away or worse she said I’m her best friend but I’m having my doubts nowadays  just FUCK I HATE THIS I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS

I decided to try this out because I watch too many YouTube videos about r/entitledparents. I don't think this would fit into that category exactly so here I go. My first language is English but I suck at grammar so I'm sorry beforehand. I don't know how else to start this... tl/dr at bottom but please read through.

To start off my brothers wife is a/an (insert long rambling list of expletives). I've done everything I could to keep nice with her but I genuinely wish she would disappear. My brother met his wife in high school. She is a diagnosed schizophrenic but I played nice. My freshman year I went to prom with my friend and she brought my brother. I was having fun with my friends and dancing. She drags her friends to the bathroom ""throws up"" and tells everyone shes pregnant (she was not). I yelled and screamed at her about how all she wanted was attention and she had to ruin everyone's night. I say ruin because everyone in high school picked on me that my sister got pregnant my senior year. Now it was rumor that I'd be pregnant by my senior year cause it was family tradition. And a night of fun turned into my brother being stressed and upset.

They broke up for a bit and my brother went into the Navy. He had the time of his life finally traveling and being away from this hell of a small town. He stopped back home and they saw each other. tad-ah my nephew is conceived. He goes back to Florida and later she announces shes having his child. My family and I are skeptical of this because she was not only with my brother she has slept with one of my exes (not salty at all he was a male genital anyways). My brother agrees with us and even gets a fiance at one point. Then she comes back... pretty much chases his fiance away and latches onto my brother. My brother can tell we don't like her but that's only because shes entitled and thinks she always needs to be in the spotlight. (shes well aware shes a brat she openly admits to it) So he secretly keeps her with him in Florida and lies to his family in fear of making us upset. DNA says its his so we say fine whatever they got a kid he can help take care of him but don't stay with her. They make nephew #2.

Now I know it takes 2 to make children. I'm well aware of that fact. And I've told my brother that he made his bed. BUT hes so depressed and easy to manipulate that i feel so sad for him.

Okay continuing 2 nephews .... they secretly get married because he would get more money for the family. She does not work AT ALL!!! She gets stressed out by the kids so she leaves the eldest with her parents or my sister. All the while she parades around with the newest kid. She tried to get into college but she gave up and said she'd be a stay at home mother. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NO she 1) doesn't discipline her children and lets them run the house. Nephew 1 has pushed a 3 year old girl into a fridge and down a flight of stairs 2) IS a disgusting human being to the point she leaves dishes piled up on the back of the couch and throws dirty diapers into a basenette that had to be bought brand new cause she can't have used things for her children. 3) Doesn't clean anything in the house to the point visitors have to move crap off the couch to sit down when visiting. 4) Doesn't take care of her children to the point they always look dirty and couldn't potty train her 5 year old after my sister got him potty trained while in her care then brothers wife completely gave up on it.

My brother god bless his soul goes to work, comes home, makes dinner, does housework, then gets to sleep for a couple of hours to go to work the next day. He gets shipped to another base in Virginia so of course the zoo needs to come along. While he goes to work he leaves her with his car and credit card/ debit card cause again she makes no income.

My family took a trip to Disney and invited my brother and his kids along but of course she came as well. THE WHOLE TIME she complained that we didn't do what she wanted to do, it was too hot (she lived in Florida for 3 years.), she needs more breaks cause they kids are making her exhausted. My sister brought along my brand spanking new niece at 1 month old while taking care of her 9 year old and no complaints from her. 3 days in she fights with my brother about doing laundry cause she wanted to skip going to the parks the next day to hang out and she can do it then. My brother wanted to spend time with us as though we don't see him often so he wanted to come with us the next day. As they argued she told my brother that she was going to leave and take my eldest nephew cause she only has her name on the birth certificate. We tell her she needs to leave cause shes making the vacation horrible. She goes to her friends in Florida with my brother cause you know his car. My brother wants to come back so we tell him okay as long as she apologizes and relaxes for the rest of the trip. She came back didn't say anything to anyone and complained to her family over text that we were talking crap about her ( which didn't happen we were trying to have fun) At the park the next day OH MY GAWD...

She forgets wipes for nephew 2 but my sister says she can share. Problem solved all is right with the world RIGHT? NO. She demand my brother and her leave the park go back to the campground to go get wipes and come back. that's an hour waist of time so my brother says no. (Disney has you catching buses back and forth and takes up so much time.) She storms off with nephew 1 and we take my brother and nephew 2 to the show with us. THE WHOLE TIME she texts him says shes gonna divorce him and she needs to feed the baby (we were giving him applesauce my sister had with her). Show ends we leave we go to meet her. SHE IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND! SHE SEND ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE AROUND THE WHOLE PARK! she doesn't answer her phone. Her friend calls my brother telling him how could he be so mean to her and steal their child. hes confused by this and says hes looking for her but she wont answer. We are about to go to security to tell them shes missing. finally she answers she left the park and shes in front. SHE CALLED THE POLICE SAYING HE KIDNAPPED HER CHILD. My brother is crying as police question him. She gets paperwork for domestic violence. My father says enough is enough walks them back to the buses and campground. Throws their things out of the camper and takes their bracelets before they left for good. The bracelets were the tickets and my father bought those. She was not going to ruin a vacation and then be able to just come back and use them by themselves. We made the best out of our vacation together.

She tells my brother we are controlling him and manipulating him. My father tells him that he wont speak to him anymore cause he cant do this anymore. They fight constantly. They've threatened divorce many times. She's racked up my brother in hospital debt (she goes to the ER for a simple cough and sniffle). They've just had my niece and again she cant handle all the kids and needs to shuck them off to someone else. She wants my brother to get out of the Navy so they can move right next to her parents house. HE MAKES ALL THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME WORKING FOR THE NAVY!!!!! She tells her friends and family that my brother wont let her do anything and makes her clean the house. SHe tried to hire a friend of hers to clean the house for her but got angry at my brother when he told her they don't have the money to do that. She makes everything seem so happy on social media then makes my brothers life a living hell.  I cant make posts about her cause it upsets my brother so I came here to rant.

I am an alcoholic/addict in recovery, I have been able to stay clean and sober for a little over 2yrs and 9months. I moved into a sober house after leaving rehab. After about 2yrs the house manager passed away from cancer and I was asked to step into the role of house manager. 

I took this purely volunteer position to give back to the house that gave me so much. I still pay rent and still adhere to the rules in place. 

I did all this while starting an apprenticeship in a Labor organization. So I am working full time 50 to 60 hours a week, going to classes every couple weeks at night, attending AA/NA meetings and trying to live my life.

I've recently completed the apprenticeship and plan on staying in the house for another year to save money and set my foundation for my future. My problem at the moment is these other men in the house are like children.  

It seems as though every little thing is a do or die situation for them. They can barely fulfill the responsibilities they agreed to before moving in while having more time seeing as they dont work as long as I do every day.

I have the same problems as they do but many of the 10 men in this house are absolutely stunted. Always looking at what other guys are getting in their lives or what they are doing and fail to look at themselves and focus on their recovery. 

I am frequently attacked for minor things like buying the wrong cereal or not buying enough coffee creamer.  I fall short and I know I am not perfect and have a long way to go myself. 

My sponsor encourages me to just come from love and service. Help the ones I can and let these guys rise or fall on their own. Especially the ones who just want to coast by. 

I have all this pressure on me and although I dont want to use or drink I started smoking cigarettes again. Finished the pack I purchased Monday today and hope not to buy anymore. Also I've started sleeping with a woman who is still actively drinking an drugging. 

I am in a 12 step program of recovery. It is frowned upon for many reasons. For those who probably arent aware I'm participating in what's called 13th stepping. It just been so long since I was intimate with a woman and she came on to me and I just had no fight left to stop her. Even though she says she is alright with it my experience from being around for a while tells me it will blow up in my face. 

I don't know how I feel about that. Part of me likes that I'm not the ""perfect"" example of working your recovery. The other part of me says fuck it. Everyone has shit they still do that is fucked up.

i brought her to the ER to be admitted last night, she was suicidal, took 2.5mg of klonopin and drank a very heavily alcoholic drink she made. she said she didn’t mean for it all to end that night, but the note she wrote suggested otherwise. but i guess she didn’t combine enough to kill her. i’ve been thanking god every time i think about her. 

i visited her today and she was miserable. i mean, by the end of my visit she seemed entirely more hopeful, she even wrote out a list of recovery goals and made a pinky swear to me (very serious verbal contract with us ,i know it seems silly) that she was going to do everything she could to get better, that she would keep on living, trying, surviving. 

what’s eating at me is that i have to be strong for her. i can’t break down during a visit and burden her with how terrible i feel, because that would be counterproductive to her recovery. i had to stop myself from crying like 3 times, she could probably tell i was holding it back, but i tried my hardest. we at least made each other laugh, it was so amazing to see her smile again. 

a thing that’s been weird and strange to me is having her phone with me. i have to turn it on like twice a day to see if her boss has messaged her or not — one of her big worries is that she’ll lose her job for missing shifts out of nowhere. i texted her boss from her phone while we were headed to the ER saying “i’m sorry but i can’t come in to my shifts this weekend or monday, i’m having a medical emergency.” he hasn’t tried to contact her since. no one from her work has. 

i didn’t snoop through the phone but something about the chat notifications (that i didn’t open — didn’t want people to think she was online when she wasn’t available at all) and seeing her email inboxes, even though they were just full of amazon receipts and newsletter/coupon emails, it all gave me this big feeling of connection to her, like, as if the phone had bits and pieces of her inside of it, like her soul or something. the phone feels a little heavier in my hand than i think its supposed to. 

i’ve been clutching it to my chest, holding it close to me while i lay down to rest, carrying it in my pocket, all while it’s completely turned off. i’ll probably sleep with it. i just feel like it’s all i have of her while she’s away right now. i feel so weird treating a phone like a teddy bear, but i just... i need it right now. i don’t know. i feel crazy. 

i’m about halfway through my last bottle of wine right now. i hid away all of her liquor because even if she doesn’t want to be 100% sober in the future, she needs to stay completely sober when she comes out of treatment and for a long while from there on. i said i would be sober wth her. but here i am getting drunk.. oh well i guess.. what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her? 

i keep sending her facebook messages because i know she won’t be able to read or reply until she’s out — i wouldn’t want to burden her with all those feelings now while she’s still in there, but it’s all things i want her to know; that i love her, she’s so perfect to me, i’m by her side forever no matter what, i’ll go to the ends of the earth to make sure she’s okay. 

i always say to her, i have priorities — i want her to be 1. Safe, 2. Healthy and 3. Happy, in that order. i mean, preferably she’d be happy all the time, but her safety and health are the most important. i feel like i failed to keep her safe because she managed to take the pills and make the drink incredibly alcoholic under my watch. my gut told me something was wrong but she seemed to be happy, smiling at me, cracking the occasional joke. but i guess i feel better that i managed to keep her safe from further harm by bringing her in. 

i don’t need help myself, i just wish i had better help in helping her. she only seems to want to talk to me though. won’t tell her family (her mom is incredibly unsupportive and in harsh denial that her child is transgender, dad is dead, all 4 brothers have bad attitudes towards her), i gave her one of her friends’ phone numbers that had reached out to me about her so she could call them, but she only wants to talk to me. 

i guess i don’t really know what i need to hear, if anything. i think i just needed to tell someone, since she’s the only person i really talk to. it’s hard just shooting messages into the void of her offline chat box. it’s hard trying to get any form of solace just by holding a phone that isn’t even turned on or doing anything. it’s just...... fuck. god bless her soul.. pray for me, y’all.

My step-daughter. I know, it shouldn't be that way. But here's the quick explanation. I met my wife in my late 20s. I'm 39 now. My step-daughter was 8. Our relationship moved fast and we got married just over a year after meeting. I don't have a biological child for reasons I won't get into. But ever since I met my wife I treated my step-daughter as my own. But as the years went buy she basically didn't want to treat me like I was her father even though her birth father has never been in the picture. She's never even met him.

Anyway, she seemed to start resenting me as she got older and our relationship was rocky at best. So basically I came to the realization that I shouldn't even bother trying to any type of father figure to her.

She's about to turn 21 and is super introverted. She has been in college since she was 18 but had to take last semester off due to financial reasons. Thank god she is going back in August, because I'm at the point I can't do it anymore. I don't even wanna see her. She just says stupid and annoying things. She doesn't listen to a word I say. I ask her to clean the kitchen, which has been her one and only chore for years, and I always get a eye roll or a sigh, and sometimes she doesn't even do it. But if her mom asks her to she just says ok cool.

The thing that annoys me the most is when she sits in the living room with me while I'm just chilling. We have a small house and I don't have a man cave or anywhere else to escape to just to be alone. I really like being alone when my wife is at work. She works 3rd shift. I just wanna chill and surf the web, stream something, play a video game, or whatever.

I know this shouldn't bother me. I know it's wrong to want her to get our of my face and not want her in the same room. But it's years and years of frustration that has built up and the fact she resents me, doesn't listen to me, back talks me, and generally just doesn't see me as a father figure has made me just not give a shit anymore.

I am so happy she is leaving for school in a couple months. She has been here since January. And it's so weird because she's always here. She has no friends. Doesn't go out with anyone or anything. Most of the time she is in her room which is where I want her to be so I can just relax.

I'm writing this now because she just spent four hours on the couch and I was about to have a panic attack.

The probably makes me a terrible person. But it's just how I've come to feel.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My step-daughter. I know, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be that way.

So, I’m a competition cheerleader, and recently (about a month ago) finished a season of competing. We got second overall in our age group, but that isn’t important. What is, is the fact that I wasn’t at three competitions. 

Let me set the scene: Second competition of the season, during the awards ceremony for the day. I’m sitting next to my brother, who coincidentally shared the same name as the DJ/announcer. My brother was making jokes, and I called him an adorable dork. My teammates look at me like I just took a crap on the floor. One of my teammates, I’ll call her K, separates me and my brother. I ask her why, and tell her that all I did was call him an adorable dork. Cue the look again. I repeat what I said, and K says,

“OP!! (Not my real name)” I look at her as the announcer passes by us. I just shut my mouth, not knowing what I did wrong, and the watch the rest of the awards. We had been announced for 2nd place, yet we didn’t get the banner. Once the awards were over, my mom, brother and I left.

**Timeskip to a few days later** 

I’m just watching some Netflix on my phone when my dad calls for me. I pause my episode and go see what he wants. My dad tells me to get my phone and bring it to him. I ask him why, and he says,

“You know *perfectly* well why.” I just shrug and comply. He then tells me that I am banned from *all* entertainment-usable electronics. I just stand there, wondering why he banned me. I am about to ask why again, and he says,

“Mom and I had a little chat about your language the other day, and decided that, until you can prove that you mature enough not to mouth off, we’re pulling you out of cheer.” This is where I break down. I, *again*, ask what I did, and he finally answers.

“You mouthed off at competition the other day and called the announcer an annoying twerp!” I am surprised, as I said no such thing. He told me that the announcer heard me, and the judges heard me through the audio mics in the cheer floor (sounds unbelievable, but yes, there are really mics there). My dad explains that, because of me, I caused us to go from 2nd place to last. I’ve stopped crying and am trying to tell my dad that I didn’t say “twerp” or **anything** bad, but he said that they showed my coach the audio. I’m crying once again, and saying that it wasn’t me, because, well, *it wasn’t*!! My dad said that everyone around me had heard, and told me to go to my room and take a nap, because I was getting moody. I’m 13, and not *once* had this kind of thing happened to me. 

Unfortunately, I ended up losing sleep, my grades dropped a *tiny* (yes, that small) bit, and began just spending my time laying on my bed and hitting my pillows. Heck, my classmates noticed that I was falling asleep in class, lost interest in my books, and my librarian (who is an amazing woman!) noticed that I wasn’t coming into the school library as often anymore (I would go every morning, and when this happened, I started going only once or twice a week).I missed three competitions because of this ban, and when I eventually returned after my mom took pity and removed it, not one of my teammates talked to me for my first three practices back. I felt terrible, and for the other girls out there, I was on *that*, and feeling crappy and uncomfortable to top it all off.

Eventually, almost everyone but my brother forgot about it (my brother still holds the fact that I got in trouble like this over my head, and brings it up to make me miserable), and things went back to normal, though I repeatedly asked my coach if I could listen to the audio recording of me supposedly saying all the bad stuff, and she would say,

“Maybe.”

The feeling is coming back. I really thought I was rid of this pestering parasite, but here it is again. Driving me to pour out my heart into this post. I just didn't know where else to go, you see, the feeling makes it hard for me to actually talk to people in my everyday life about how I'm actually feeling inside and it's scaring me because it's getting harder and harder to hide it in my moods/expressions throughout the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

It all began when I was about 11/12 when my parents went through divorce, my best friends moved hours away, my grandfather passed and I was changing schools and starting middle school all within a month and a half of each other. I was suffocating. The oldest of my siblings it was my job to assume the role of the mother who abandoned us, and to try and make up for the time our dad was working his life away to try and provide for us. I automatically became the cook, maid and tutor for kids that weren't actually mine. Being only 12, I was too young to relate to any adults but I was much more mature than anyone I ever hung out with in school, which I didn't mind, although now i do feel like I had a lot of missed opportunities and grew up way too fast. I was always the ""mom"" friend, making sure everyone was having a good time before I worried about myself, I started to become very anxious and self conscious about my actions. I felt like everyone was watching my every move, judging me harshly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward some years, I am now 19 and all the feelings of despair, loneliness and anxiety are coming back in full force. The feeling is so hard to describe. It's an icy cold shock through my whole system. It makes it so any time I attempt to eat, I feel like I need to throw it all up immediately because everyone is silently judging my weight (note, I am a 5'5 female and I weigh roughly 180). I feel trapped. I never feel like I can open up to anyone, because I'm slowly realizing how fake any people I would have considered friends are turning out to be. They're all mostly coworkers and I always have someone telling me what he/she said, but what they don't realize is they all are talking about each other but act super fake to each others faces and I get to witness it all. So my head is telling me there's no way they're not doing it to me, even though I'm just a middle ground and no gossip really ever leaves me, and I keep my personal life very far from work. For example, I've worked with these people for roughly two years and I doubt any of them could tell you relatively common information such as my birthday, how many siblings I have or what city I'm originally from (yes, I could tell you any one of their whole life stories). And while I could talk to my boyfriend, I don't feel right doing it. He works at the same place as me but he's part of security so he's not really able to talk to me about anything that he's working on/looking into. So it makes it hard to have conversation when I know a lot of what is happening in my department, and I tell him but then he can't tell me if it lead anywhere/what's being done about certain situations. It almost makes me want to keep things from him (like gossip I hear about, and rules I hear about being broken), just because I don't really get anything out of it except for helping him with his job. I don't know. I'm also just worried he'll get sick of me being so depressed/anxious all of the time, since I've had so many loved ones walk out of my life because of it before (a story for a later time). 

&amp;#x200B;

I went way off track. I only wrote all of this out at 1 a.m. because I fantasized about self harming again on the way home from work tonight, even though I know it's stupid and it doesn't help anything, it just causes more stress. So instead of doing something stupid, I came on here and wrote this sloppy, erratic post that I don't even know if anyone is gonna read or not. I can't decide if it's helped or not to write this out or not, I honestly feel like I could go on writing for hours and hours and never end trying to describe the darkness I've been feeling in my chest. It's like someone's reaching into my chest and squeezing the air out of my lungs and crushing my heart, making me feel cold as ice and numb.

Its franchised from the main company though.
I have been working there since March as a secretary and a porter delivering vehicles back to our fleet accounts.

There is the 60 yr old owner (let's call him money bags scrooge) and his son who is the GM and an assistant manager. 

A month ago, an incident happened where Scrooge brought in thrift store towels because it was affordable to him. (He sits on over a million  in net worth btw due to all his real estate side business.) He asked me to take a blade and cut the towels in half that he uses for 20k to 50k valued cars.... let that sink in.... Used....Rough.... Thrift store bought....Towels. Well I told him once I get the chance to stand still at the shop and not be constantly porting vehicles back and forth, I would take care if the towels.

Fast forward Thursday and Friday (which were busy) and come Monday, I go to the storage room and start cutting them up. Owner comes in an hour later and starts to lecture me on how I'm a liar and that this should have been down when he told me to................... I calmly explained that due to the new fleet account, I was on the road constantly and just now had a chance to get around to it. He flipped on me. Like wtf dude...what do you want me to do? Tell your son, sorry manager, I cant go deliver this car bc your dad wants me to cut towels in half..... ugh...that's not all.

Owner went on a week trip with another coworker to go fish. I guess I was bitched about the entire fishing trip and the older porter who went with him told me some fatherly advice: if the owner asks you to do something just do it. I was very upset over this but I was like whatever. I'll just do mybeork and that's it.

Next issue, we have 2 dumpsters. One is for recycling and the other for everything. Recycling dumpster DOESNT ALLOW plastic film tarp etc or paint hazardous materials. I place painted overspray paper and film into regular dumpster and the owner comes out telling me that I need 5o getvit out and place into recycling. At this point I argue that it's against the rules of the company that provided the bin for us. He tells me not to argue with him and that I should not think and just do. 

Cue the awkward silence.   

And lastly, you all will get a kick out of this....we are on a run to deliver and pick up a car. Its quiet awkward in the car. I'm afraid to say anything because anything you say is used as a reason to lecture you.

Owner suddenly says, I need you to serve some eviction papers to a tenant of mine. I'm thinking one of the buildings standing next to our shop.....Noooooo he meant a private non company property. This is the Southside of chicago....I dont know who this tenant is, all the owner said was that the sherriff couldnt serve the papers bc the tenant isnt home.... um ok... he tells me its easy.

Sorry I had red flags all around on this request and there is No way in effing hell I am going to risk my life to serve eviction papers when its NOT my job to do so....

Give me your all and nothing else.

 There's just so much goddamned weight on my shoulders All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware

I'm hell on heels, say what you will
I've done made the devil a deal
He made me pretty
He made me smart

Steady as a needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
Thirty-three, forty-five, seventy-eight
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice my past can't run me down
Standing at the sink now, looking in a mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well, the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting
I'm through with doubt
There's nothing left for me to figure out
I've paid a price, and I'll keep paying
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell, and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is
You think I should
I know you said
Why can't you just get over it?
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
I made my bed, and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets, and I don't mind saying
It's a sad, sad story

In a way she's a lot like me
She don't give a damn 'bout society
Might be little rich girl
She's a outlaw woman - first of the kind
These outlaw women - ridin' high in seventy-nine

About your leadership
And I will straight up
Leave your shit
Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed
Just one more fight
And I'll be history
Yes, I will straight up
Leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left
Missing me

Feel like i'm drowning

I'm the bad guy","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not real great sometime with words. So giving this a go..... Different song lyrics &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be the vilian you can blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me your all and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just so much goddamned weight on my shoulders All I&amp;#39;m trying to do is live my motherfucking life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I&amp;#39;ve become so numb, I can&amp;#39;t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hell on heels, say what you will
I&amp;#39;ve done made the devil a deal
He made me pretty
He made me smart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steady as a needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
Thirty-three, forty-five, seventy-eight
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice my past can&amp;#39;t run me down
Standing at the sink now, looking in a mirror
Don&amp;#39;t know where I am or how I got here
Well, the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I&amp;#39;m not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I&amp;#39;m still waiting
I&amp;#39;m through with doubt
There&amp;#39;s nothing left for me to figure out
I&amp;#39;ve paid a price, and I&amp;#39;ll keep paying
I&amp;#39;m not ready to make nice
I&amp;#39;m not ready to back down
I&amp;#39;m still mad as hell, and I don&amp;#39;t have time
To go &amp;#39;round and &amp;#39;round and &amp;#39;round
It&amp;#39;s too late to make it right

My sister sent all her friends shit they didn’t need to know about. And most of it was lies too. Now, the friend knows me and the friend and really good with each other so she tells him first. I really miss him and she’s tried to talk to another really close friend.

backstory: i dated this kid on and off for about a year. easily the worst relationship i have ever been in. looking back, i don’t know why i stayed. i was miserable all the time, he treated me like shit, he would touch me in my sleep and masturbate while i was pretty much unconscious and it got to the point where i had to tell him to stop, he had no respect for me, and he would take pictures of women while they weren’t looking and i caught him in the act doing it once. it makes me feel sick. 

yesterday, i went into my old snapchat. sometimes people message me on there and i check it to let people know i have a new one and to just message me on there. when i logged in, i noticed he had screenshotted something within our chat. panic consumed me because i didn’t know what it was and i immediately thought it was one of my nudes. i messaged him and confronted him about it (i’m still somewhat new to reddit, if i can figure out how to post a thread of the texts i will). why would anyone EVER need to screenshot an old conversation? regardless if it’s a meme or not. wouldn’t it be common courtesy to say “hey, i screenshotted, but this is what it was”. he immediately got defensive and angry with me (and also immediately turned off his reads so he could ignore me. making himself look even more guilty) and i just went in on him. i didn’t believe him because my boyfriend (who is so lovely and supportive and i appreciate him so much) and i briefly broke up. before we broke up i asked my ex if he still had my nudes; he said no. when my bf and i broke up BRIEFLY he admitted he still had them AND USED THEM. so when i began questioning him, he got all pissed off and then blocked me on every social media possible. he made me feel gross and like my privacy was invaded. i don’t even know what it was and his explanation was bullshit and contradicted itself (again, will be posting the screenshots and linking them below). i just started to relive all of the bullshit he had put me through and i couldn’t stop thinking about how he would masturbate and touch me while i was asleep. it makes my stomach hurt so much. 

it makes my boyfriend uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable, i doubt he’s deleted them and i’m honestly overthinking. after what happened to bella thorne i’m on edge over this. i doubt he would do something like that but the thought of my images still being used makes me sick. not to mention they’re almost a year old (even over a year old at this point).

About two years ago,was the last time I saw Slag. I worked about 40 hours a week,and it was an hour long drive just to see her,but I did it when I could. She,however,NEVER made that same effort. It was one excuse or another,but mostly it was because she was a dead-beat who couldn't hold a job,and lived off of her boyfriend who we will call Simpson. Slag met Simpson on a dating app while she was still with her ex. I regret not telling either guy at the time) . One of her excuses was ""oh we just bout an x-box 1 so I don't have the money to come hang out."" 
I was so incredibly hurt by that. Especially because I knew she didn't spend a penny on that thing. 
So the last time I saw this cunt, it was the usual lazy hangout.  But she invited her ""best friend"" . He had been coined as such because I hadn't been able to make it out to her in about a month. (But he was actually a friend of her boyfriend, and both guys happened to look STRIKINGLY similar.)Before that ,I was her ""best friend"" .She kept bringing it up all day  "" WhatsHisFace is my best friend."" Clearly attempting to make me jealous. But I didn't give a fuck. WhatsHisFace was cute and I was busy flirting with him. And maybe that was why she did it. Maybe she thought that by repeating it,she would think it would deter him or myself from pursuing one another. 
Time passed,drinks start flowing,Simpson comes home from work. He notices chemistry between WhatsHisFace and I and says "" I knew you two would hit it off"" meanwhile his girlfriend is in the corner,seething. Why this wasn't suspicious to him,is beyond me. 
Later in the evening ,WhatsHisFace  and I engage in consensual sex.  Slag catches us and FLIPS.THE FUCK.OUT. told us to get out of her house immediately. But ALL of us were intoxicated and WhatsHisFace and I were NOT  about to do something completely stupid, despite that. 
I left the next morning,after saying no more than two words to Slag,and feeling really guilty,like I was the one that sabotaged our friendship. I spent a week or two apologizing and trying to talk to her. After exchanging texts with her and with this supposed ""best friend"" of hers, I realized there was something going on between the two of them . So I called them out on it. Moments later I get a phone call from WhatsHisFace, yelling about how I shouldn't text those kinds of things because [of her past] Simpson might take it seriously . To which I said ""if there is nothing going on then you two have nothing to worry about. "" 

Slag and Simpson broke up about a month later. 
Turns out something WAS going on. 

Now I would like to mention that I had known Slag for almost 20 years. She used to beat me up when we were younger,but as we were both outcasts in our adolescent years, we grew closer together. And after high school,even closer yet. 
She had several boyfriends in high school (even got pregnant by one and had an abortion when we were 16) and at least three more when we were friends after high school. 
 I am not one to slut shame,as I have been known to be promiscuous.I'm not proud of it,but it's a fact and I will not deny it. However I WILL berate anyone who is willingly foolish. 
 The second boyfriend that I know of ,we can call him Burgundy, was a sweetheart, but a dim one. I do not blame her for ending that relationship ,but even as she was in the midst of ending it she would literally,out-loud,from her stupid  mouth,say "" I don't care if I get pregnant ,I know we are going to be together forever."" One of my greatest pet peeves is people doing the same dumb shit over and over again and never learning from their mistakes. 
About a week later, after cheating on,and subsequently leaving Burgundy( whom she lived with. In his parents basement .among cat turds) she moved into her mother's house, with Simpson.
And my gay,alcoholic, best friend (Those details are important, but not for this vent sesh).
Within a month of knowing,dating,and living together, Slag starts singing that same,old,song ""I don't care if I get pregnant,I know we are going to be together forever "" (notice a pattern?)



About two days ago I finally saw a  picture of Slag ,her baby,and her baby daddy.
To which I said "" I remember when you were with Burgundy and you would say 'I don't care if I get pregnant. I know we're going to be together forever' .Simpson, too. But that guy...doesn't look like either of them "" 

She responded but I have no idea what was said.

 I know my words cut deep. Slag and I really were close friends. Which means we knew one another's weak points.

Within a month of knowing,dating,and living together, Slag starts singing that same,old,song &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care if I get pregnant,I know we are going to be together forever &amp;quot; (notice a pattern?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two days ago I finally saw a  picture of Slag ,her baby,and her baby daddy.
To which I said &amp;quot; I remember when you were with Burgundy and you would say &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t care if I get pregnant. I know we&amp;#39;re going to be together forever&amp;#39; .Simpson, too. But that guy...doesn&amp;#39;t look like either of them &amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She responded but I have no idea what was said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my words cut deep. Slag and I really were close friends. Which means we knew one another&amp;#39;s weak points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&lt;/p&gt;

I have caught the feelings for this girl, we talked a bit we're both seventeen and we have a few things in common. But we were different in many ways. She became the outgoing type junior year and.. I also grew alot this year personally. I performed dances, played the piano for Asian night practing while surviving the hell of school. I was always the shy type in all honesty. I liked a few girls back then but nothing really happened because I didn't do anything about it hahaha. And when they got with another mans I was absolutely destroyed.

I started texting her a lot... I seem thirsty?

But after getting attached for so long I did my research I have friends who know her kinda well and are close to her that were also close to me. I've heard that she smoked weed ate edibles and drank alcohol... I was like wtf is this really true. But even through I knew that I went forward to tell her to meet me up at a park called highrock tower and.. I confessed ""I like you"" she didn't know how to respond..  I wasn't exactly phased by this.. but I got to learn her and we talkrd for 2 hours.. apparently she has dated multiple boys and that does bother me alot also but I still want to be with here at her side. After that we still texted and as usual did streaks I commented on some of her snaps that she sent me. But on the inside a shy boy has never really been close to any girl outside of his home before. So I reacted to alot of things that should be normal like saving messaged and the Snapchat notification telling me if she's texting or not. Apparently I was the first one to confess in such a dramatic way hahaha. But right now I feel like if she actually liked me she would've gave me the same Attention... She's popular and these text messages may seem like nothing to her honestly I'm so fucking sick of this... I wanted to show her my affection that GOT ME NO WHERE... She added me to her private story's and it's just her talking about her sad life and stuff there was a new one today and it showed a picture of a dude sitting on a chair with her face covering his saying that ""I loveee this dudee have my babysss"" I saw that and I was so what destroyed again.. the same thing repeated. She gives me mixed messages tbh. And what should I do guys. I feel like I should tell her to straight up tell me that "" I don't like you"" BUT SHE SAID SHE HASNT REJECTED ME AT ALL IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE. It is possible that she is a pretty girl and guys just do whatever to get to her and abuse her... Fuck I'm gonna get banned for this because of how long this is.... All I wanted was to show her my love and I wanted her to show me back the affection I gave to her.

I wasn&amp;#39;t exactly phased by this.. but I got to learn her and we talkrd for 2 hours.. apparently she has dated multiple boys and that does bother me alot also but I still want to be with here at her side. After that we still texted and as usual did streaks I commented on some of her snaps that she sent me. But on the inside a shy boy has never really been close to any girl outside of his home before. So I reacted to alot of things that should be normal like saving messaged and the Snapchat notification telling me if she&amp;#39;s texting or not. Apparently I was the first one to confess in such a dramatic way hahaha. But right now I feel like if she actually liked me she would&amp;#39;ve gave me the same Attention... She&amp;#39;s popular and these text messages may seem like nothing to her honestly I&amp;#39;m so fucking sick of this... I wanted to show her my affection that GOT ME NO WHERE... She added me to her private story&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s just her talking about her sad life and stuff there was a new one today and it showed a picture of a dude sitting on a chair with her face covering his saying that &amp;quot;I loveee this dudee have my babysss&amp;quot; I saw that and I was so what destroyed again.. the same thing repeated. She gives me mixed messages tbh. And what should I do guys. I feel like I should tell her to straight up tell me that &amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t like you&amp;quot; BUT SHE SAID SHE HASNT REJECTED ME AT ALL IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE. It is possible that she is a pretty girl and guys just do whatever to get to her and abuse her... Fuck I&amp;#39;m gonna get banned for this because of how long this is.... All I wanted was to show her my love and I wanted her to show me back the affection I gave to her. And she already found a man&amp;#39;s skull and didn&amp;#39;t really tell me about it because she doesn&amp;#39;t care about this text and talk once in a while relationship. I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sick of this I think I&amp;#39;m just gonna forget about her&lt;/p&gt;

He is honestly the most amazing husband a person could ever ask for, and hands down the best Dad ever.  He's never really been healthy, but never really sick either. Which looking back, it's more like, he just never wanted to complain when he wasn't feeling well or something felt off. We also have a 21 medically fragile, special needs son. So, my husband has never made himself a priority, especially healthwise.

Last night, he ran to the store to pick up some things for dinner. On his way to the store, he began experiencing severe chest pain. He continued to drive to the store and went in and got the groceries. The entire time, being in severe pain in his chest and pain in his shoulder and jaw. He didnt want to worry me, as he says, so he didn't call me. He says he didnt want to cause a scene, so he didnt call 911 or even ask anyone in the store for assistance. The grocery store has a pharmacy with a few chairs in front of it, he said he sat there a few times taking breaks. He then went to the car and drove home, about 10 miles. (I'm soooooo angry at him for not only risking his life, but others as well).

He got home...even carrying in the groceries, while I still had no clue any of this was going on. I went to grab some of the groceries to start dinner when he asked me to wait. It was not until then, that I knew anything was going on. Once he finally told me and I turned on a light to actually see him, I knew it was bad. He told me not to call 911 as he thought it was just indigestion, but after a few minutes agreed to let me drive him to the emergency room.  (Yes, i know, I really should have called 911).

They were doing an ekg before i could even finish signing him in to the er. The ekg was normal, but blood tests revealed that he did in fact have a heart attack. His blood pressure was also 214/195 (yikes). He is currently stable and is acting like nothing happened, with the exception of some major fatigue. His blood sugar is also very high. He was on blood pressure medicine and metformin for pre-diabetes for a few years and stopped taking them. Basically just didnt take them seriously and didnt make his health a priority. He's, been off of them for about a year. 

They moved him to a larger hospital today, which is one of the top heart hospitals in the country. They are planning to do a heart catherization on Monday to determine the level of blockage he has and will take treatment from there. I felt he was safe enough tonight for me to come home to be with my youngest son (16) and get a shower and sleep.

I dont know what I would do if I lost this man. I dont want to live a day on this earth without him. He's only 49. I pray that this is the wake up call he needs that it's time to put himself first and take better care of himself. I also pray it makes me realize all he does for us and how I need to do everything I can to take some of the burden off of him. I pray this changes our lives...for the better. 

On a totally unrelated note, I got a call from a coworker today who told me that someone is ""throwing my name under the bus"" and telling our manager that I'm not doing my job. Apparently, she sat and went through 16 hours of camera footage to see what I was doing while unsupervised. Coworker said she didnt say if she saw anything that concerned her or not. Unless she has a different idea of what I should be doing at work, then I dont believe I've done anything wrong. Especially not on the same level that other coworkers do (using petty cash for personal use, taking 2 hour lunch breaks that include a lot of alcohol twice a week, lying, and other obvious abuses of company time - but I would never bring any of this up, as I dont tattle or gossip). I think my manager is looking for a reason to get rid of me, as I am paid differently and more than everyone else due to the amount of travel I do. 

I so desperately just want to tell them to all F off, but right now, more than ever, I need that damn job. Of course, my hubby is the one who would give me the best advice and let me vent for hours if I needed to, and now, I cant even bring it up to him.

I'm also so fucking tired of this relationship. Holy fuck. I want to be single and be alone for a while but when i mention i want to be alone or like take a break she starts talking about that she hates herself and want to die and stupid fucking shit like that. Fuck.

I know that they need help with the kid and everytime i'm not around i feel bad for them and feel shitty about myself just because i just wanted to be alone and play video games or some stupid shit.

Just need somewhere to let this all out. I really do hate girl problems.

  


So I met this girl in the library while I was studying for exams. She was really cute and sweet and we went on two dates that I think we both had a good time on. It was the furthest I had ever been with a girl so I was very happy and excited to see what would happen.

Thing is she was a really really bad texter. She often would take 3 days to reply to my messages. Initially she did acknowledge this and apologise, saying she was stressed because of exams. I understood and let it slide, obviously studies are more important than a guy and I had heard pretty bad things about her year's exams.

  


She went back to her home country after exams for a few weeks, and I thought she would be able to text more often. Apparently not! She still took days to reply, and I had had enough so I texted her saying that I couldn't do this anymore and I wanted someone who could actually give me 20 seconds of their time to check their messages. She said she was on a break from social media (not a good excuse at all) and was planning to text me soon to organise another date. Honestly this was very confusing, on one hand the lack of messages indicated she wasn't very interested but then she still wanted to go on a date?

  


It turns out that we actually got the same job with the uni we go to, so when I saw her again I apologised for the abrupt break up and since we were working together I wanted to remain friends. She agreed and said that ""we just had different ideas of what a relationship is"". Honestly this confuses me so much, I have no idea what her idea of a relationship is if she can't take the time to try and talk to someone she's dating. It's so weird too, I see her all the time on her phone texting her friends, even when we are working or at some work social event. Obviously I'm probably not nearly as close or important as her friends, we haven't known each other for long. But it it still implies she can put the effort and time into keeping in touch with someone if she wants to which just sucks for me, but such is life.

  


My major problem is that even after all that I still like her. We have so much in common and she's still really pretty. I find myself constantly looking to see what she's up to, resisting the urge to chat to her constantly and getting jealous when she's talking and laughing with another guy, even if there's nothing going on. I honestly really hate this, I'm stuck in a limbo between liking her and wanting to date her but also realising that being just friends is way better she probably doesn't feel the same way, or even if she did it wouldn't work out. It also makes me feel bad, why am I feeling like this towards someone I'm not even seeing. Does the jealousy make me creepy? I don't want to be like that and I just want to move on and for her and I to just be happy, even if it means just being friends. I just hope that this will wear off sometime, but a part of me wants to hold on to see if we can really make it work.

I had literally no where else to go as I was leaving an abusive ex at the time and near broke af, so I had to take what I could get. Her rules where simple; no men in the house whatsoever (ladies where okay but not overnight) and no noise after a certain time so she and her pre-teen daughter could sleep. I was given a room but there are about 5 total in this house which where at first all accessible. I had to take this place in case my ex wanted to ""come over"", I was scared. 

At first all seemed okay, but then she started bringing over this man from the church. ""Oh I know him for like 2 years all is good he's a good man won't hurt anyone!"" Umm...okay but my guy friends I've also known for longer and woudn't hurt a fly but I ""can't have them over you cannot trust them they might copy a key and come back later and hurt us!"" I let it slide as I was cool with this man (he really is a nice church man) plus it's her house she can do what she pleases. But then she starts having kids over, like kids between 2 and 10 over after church activities. They would scream and jump and make all hell of noises till 12AM....when I am trying to sleep since like 9PM so I can be at work on time and awake. Then I come home and there's this lady I don't know whatsoever sitting in the living room...no one else is home. WTF. I bring these concerns to landlady. ""Oh they are all church friends I know them well they are good people!"" Yeah, but not cool to have them randomly show up here when the whole reason I am not really to have guests over is FOR THAT EXACT REASON.

My other issue is that my internet is shit in my room. Told her she said she would look into a signal booster. The router is in the basement, on the floor. I move it to a chair and magically my internet in my upstairs room is working! Then as suddenly as it's working, it stops. So I head back down to check what it up with it. Door has new doorknob, it locks. Well least the sitting room is still open so I spend time downstairs beside the router room job hunting and such (at this point I have lost my job and looking for a new one) I come down today and...the sitting room is now locked. WTF!? All the rooms but mine have locks on them!! Landlady keeps telling me she ""trusts me"" yet won't listen to my concerns or issues and has now blocked off every room but the kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and living room. I can't be in my room since the internet won't work but I want my privacy while online as well, I should not have to sit in the kitchen or living room to job hunt. Any time I bring up an issue it's basically replied with ""we need to be safe, we need to trust each other."" Yet I am not allowed to do anything apparently and you're allowed to do whatever. 

Again, I know it's her house she can do what she wants. But when you start to fell like a prisoner in the place you're supposed to be ""safe"" in it starts to gnaw at you until you want to scream.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As the school year ends, I've noticed that I talk about school more then I used to and that is because of some of the tragic things and scarring things that happened when I was going through my 7th grade year, from oldest to newest incidents. I will be using the first letters of all the names here but my name is Morgan if you didn't know.

&amp;#x200B;

1. J's suicidal thoughts 

J' s in freshmen year of high school and this started around something called DDP I think, at first he was just mopey with all this pressure and other stuff, which is normal, but it evolved into... well.... you know. This is really hard to write about for me and tear up a bit every time I retell this story. But more importantly, J was talking about self harm, lack of self worth I was crying over my computer as I talked to my friend about avoiding taking his own life. There is no doubt in my mind that this was because of DDP, because it wasn't just J. C went to bed at 5pm, I never talked to anyone for days, and V was so tired she lacked basic cognitive functions. J's was the biggest, I stayed up till around 3-4 in the morning. Also, my brother L slept even more then C did. all these people were in freshmen year of high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. CC's depression

CC is my closest friend and this happened for 3 months and ended 3 months ago. He would come over and we would just play video games, standard stuff, then I noticed something, he would say something depressing, at first I thought he was joking because it's a middle school, weird sense of humor. But I got more and more loud if you will, I didn't know what this was but it had something to do with his grades judging by the depressed comments. Not so coincidentally, these comments died down, and the final project of the 3rd Quarter ended at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Me

I don't consider my experiences as bad as the other's but this took place around January, at the time, I had recently came out as bisexual, people's reaction to this was a factor in my slowly vanishing mental health at the time. The first was the homophobia, the ""that's gay!"" as an insult is a real thing, just because you say it doesn't hurt, doesn't make it true, this kind of chipped away at my spirit and made me regret coming out at the time and wished I had kept it to myself for a while. Right now I can comfortably say I have what kids consider to be odd hobbies but back then it really bogged down on me, people mocked me, a lot, at first I hid it, then i slept the problems away, I was kind of depressed at the time and I also thought I had anxiety, I have absolutely no idea what changed my mental state between then and now but I assume it has to do with my cousin. I visited him frequently and I wanted to be what my siblings failed to do years ago, be a good older brother. This boosted my confidence and I want from depressed about the insults to apathetic about them, my confidence rose and I got better, this is probably going to be longer then the other ones because I can give more detail

&amp;#x200B;

   4. The Blame Game

Is it just me or does every time something like this happens, people will find any reason other then school, if you're a teacher, check in with your students about this stuff, don't let anybody go through this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CC&amp;#39;s depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CC is my closest friend and this happened for 3 months and ended 3 months ago. He would come over and we would just play video games, standard stuff, then I noticed something, he would say something depressing, at first I thought he was joking because it&amp;#39;s a middle school, weird sense of humor. But I got more and more loud if you will, I didn&amp;#39;t know what this was but it had something to do with his grades judging by the depressed comments. Not so coincidentally, these comments died down, and the final project of the 3rd Quarter ended at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t consider my experiences as bad as the other&amp;#39;s but this took place around January, at the time, I had recently came out as bisexual, people&amp;#39;s reaction to this was a factor in my slowly vanishing mental health at the time. The first was the homophobia, the &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s gay!&amp;quot; as an insult is a real thing, just because you say it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt, doesn&amp;#39;t make it true, this kind of chipped away at my spirit and made me regret coming out at the time and wished I had kept it to myself for a while. Right now I can comfortably say I have what kids consider to be odd hobbies but back then it really bogged down on me, people mocked me, a lot, at first I hid it, then i slept the problems away, I was kind of depressed at the time and I also thought I had anxiety, I have absolutely no idea what changed my mental state between then and now but I assume it has to do with my cousin. I visited him frequently and I wanted to be what my siblings failed to do years ago, be a good older brother. This boosted my confidence and I want from depressed about the insults to apathetic about them, my confidence rose and I got better, this is probably going to be longer then the other ones because I can give more detail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Blame Game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me or does every time something like this happens, people will find any reason other then school, if you&amp;#39;re a teacher, check in with your students about this stuff, don&amp;#39;t let anybody go through this.&lt;/p&gt;

We take care of a few ""stray"" cats, have for years because their original owners lived a few houses down. They moved out and left them to die. They escaped the yard and found the food we left out for the two kitties we already fed. No big deal. 

Carlos and Bo are twin, long-haired tuxedos. Gorgeous and friendly, but not nuisances at all. They didn't bother people. They came to our house for breakfast and dinner; every day without fail since they were abandoned years ago. They would be welcomed inside, but we have dogs that would just torment them. Had the dogs first. So, giving them food, water, and a yard to rest in was the best we could offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today? Three officers showed up to tell us; ""A neighbor called and said they hadn't see you guys in a few days. They're concerned and there is a dead cat in your yard."" 

First off, we're in and out all of the time. Between jobs, taking out the trash, and daily meals for the kitties. So, that's utter crap. Red flag, number one. 

Secondly, the only three neighbors we have the know us and care about us would have walked over and come to check themselves. One family is on vacation, the other is elderly, and the last has a number of kids that greet us every time we go in and out. They play out front with their mother just about every day. Red flag, number two.

Next off, we have brand new neighbors right next door. They're very odd (just give off bad and uncomfortable vibes) and rather rude. Also, only the youngest member of the family (a small boy) speaks any english- making communication with them nearly impossible. They are who we suspect, because all of our surrounding neighbors (even ones we're aren't close to) know we take care of those cats. These new neighbors do not know that, or simply do not care. Red flag, number three.

Continuing on, Bo was perfectly healthy and happy just yesterday. He and his brother, both, were fine. Bo was dead in our yard, on the side of the yard nearest the new neighbors. He had clearly thrown up not long before dying either. Red flag, number four. 

After that, while two of us were preparing a burial site for him, another housemate found something odd in the yard near his body. We couldn't take him to the vet for cremation due to maggots; so, burial was the best option. What was found? A decently sized dark green cap with day old tuna left in it. There was some left, but some had been eaten. We NEVER feed the cats tuna, they're rather picky and quite like their cat food. They don't even like cat treats. They'll eat tuna, but it's not their favorite. HUGE red flag. 

At this point, we all just looked at each other. That cap didn't belong to any of us or anything we owned or had ever owned. I firmly believe it was green so it would be hidden well within the grass. Also, it was placed out of view from us behind our garbage cans that sit on the side of driveway. Even when we took trash out, we wouldn't be able to see it. It was only found because we had to move his body; which was in the side of the yard not far from where the lid of tuna was hidden. 

We bagged it up, and none of us touched it. I doubt we can actually do anything with it- but we were sure not to get our prints on it. Just in case we can use it as evidence and it can be dusted for prints. Not that anyone is ever going to care enough. Our cat is gone, and now we fear for the lives of our others. Bo's twin brother; Carlos, and a short-haired tuxedo we call Sturt. Sturt is the youngest, he showed up here as a small kitten about a year ago and never left. We lost our domestic longhair, Stormy, a few years back due to anti-freeze poisoning. It wasn't done on purpose, we think he got under someone's car, got it on his paws or fur and then licked it off. We had to put him to sleep and had him cremated. Our oldest, a siamese, SK, we lost almost two years prior to Stormy, simply passed in his sleep of old age. We had him cremated as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I deeply and sincerely hope Carlos and Sturt understand what has happened to Bo and will find someplace else to get food and water. We're still going to keep our food and water here, as well as constantly check the yard for anymore poisoned tuna. We plan to check daily. Sturt was on our property, but left to wherever he and Carlos go during the day to sleep. I know they don't sleep here. Sturt does sometimes, but not super often. I won't be surprised if they don't show up for supper tonight, but it would be nice to know they're okay. Especially Carlos; we haven't since him since yesterday and this all happened before breakfast was given to them. He'll scratch on our front door if we miss a meal for him. I'm hoping he does that sometime today or at least shows up at sundown for dinner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Carlos and Bo were my babies. They were there when we lost SK and Stormy. They welcomed Sturt when he stumbled in as a kitten. Now, Bo is gone and Carlos may be as well. All because some asshole decided they didn't like them, or just because they're sick and twisted. The new neighbors called the cops. Which makes me lean towards the sick and twisted side about it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

DON'T give me any of the, ""they may not have done it,"" crap. No one else would have done it. There's no way my perfectly healthy boy died naturally. There were NO wounds on him. So, he was not attacked by a dog or another cat. And the lid with old tuna in it in the grass on the side of the yard nearest the new neighbors. Those people have given me bad vibes and made my gut roll since they moved in. Something just isn't right with them. I wish we could afford to get an investigation or some kind of justice. But, we can't. And honestly? Those people are kinda of terrifying. Like ring their doorbell and find a gun to your head; kind of terrifying. 

So, the best we can do is be vigilant and remove any further attempts to harm our cats if they decide to keep doing it. We're all hoping they stop. But, my gut isn't settling. I don't think they will. Not until all of our cats are dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

WHY?! Just why? Who's that messed up? That cruel? They aren't bothersome. They don't even go in that yard because it's gravel and not grass. They're only around the house twice a day to get food and water. Otherwise, they're elsewhere to sleep the day away.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just need to vent, feel free to ignore me. &lt;/p&gt;

I told her that I’m not sure because I don’t have much money left and I’d like to spend the next couple months in Hong Kong with my gf. Anyway, my friend just wouldn’t give up and she’s hella persuasive (or perhaps pushy?) at times and she really caught me off guard - a few days before the rent deadline for the summer. 

I ended up making a very brash decision to quit my job in HK and go travelling (it was only part time tutoring but it was income and paid my living costs + a bit extra). At the time I thought it would be really fun.

Fast forward a couple weeks, my friend and her classmate arrive in HK, she’s being hella negative constantly, complaining everything here is too expensive, she can’t afford to eat etc etc. She leaves without trying most of the local food but is dragging me out to drink with her every single night. 

One night drinking together, my friend goes through my insta to see an old Chinese essay I uploaded to insta, she starts reading it out to make fun of my chinese (she’s a chinese major and so is her friend whereas I just study it in my spare time) and I jokingly say ‘hey dude if you’re gonna mock my shitty chinese at least use the right tones’ and she fucking explodes. She was furious. Her friend was shocked too. 

Every time we met since then she’s found a reason to not just get angry but livid. Not just at me, but towards her classmate too. One day, she spent 3 hours late at night waiting for her laundry to dry (idk why she didn’t just sleep tbh), and the result was nothing dried but the washing machine ruined her shorts. She was angry again and directed it towards her classmate, the climax was when she threw a shoe at her face from a meter away (luckily the dumb bitch has a terrible aim). 

She’s constantly bringing up my money situation too. At one point she did this in front of strangers so I told her ‘hey HK is more expensive than taiwan and at least I travelled during the year - I purchased 4 return flights. And btw it’s not your place to pry into my finances, especially after you told me it’s ok if I want to keep a low budget’

Yesterday we fought again because I’m spending time on google etc looking up things to do, planning the itinerary, transport, accommodation etc - all for her to tell me ‘nah I don’t like it’ and says we should just ‘ask someone’ about literally everything. Her carefree attitude has resulted in us getting scammed a total of 3 times so far:

The first time was because she wanted us to trust the shady guy selling phone cards right at the border, instead of going to a shop. 100rmb, gone.

The second was when she insisted that instead of taking a bus or other public transport to a location, we should definitely go to a travel agent to book a taxi for us - cost us triple the fare on the meter and he dropped us off 1.5km from the intended destination. 

Thirdly, her and her classmate got a tour bus somewhere, and the driver only took them part way, requesting an additional 200rmb to finish the journey. 

When I pointed out that at least I’m doing some research instead of just complaining all the time
She tells me ‘you’re all talk and no action’ despite the fact that I’ve been leading us around everywhere to find things to do. She’s literally contributed nothing. Furthermore she told me I’m ruining the trip and she refuses to stick to my ‘cheap ass budget’ and eat in ‘shitty local canteens’ another day. 

First off: she was at first supportive of the fact I need to budget tighter. Secondly, I’ve been taking her to local restaurants. When we were in Guangdong province I was already quite familiar with the local food due to having spent a year in Hong Kong and thought she’d appreciate it since were travelling. Finally, she’s routinely skipping meals only to snack on things like Oreos, waiting to go eat pizza and drink beer in bars later on. And she insists we take a taxi everywhere while kicking up a stink when I bought a metro card in Guangzhou for 50rmb to save buying singles everywhere and give us a little flexibility. 

I’ve ditched her now btw, but she’s still taking the moral high ground. She did this whole speech on our group chat about how she was ready to forgive me until I ‘patronised’ her about something. (Pointing our that ive had no phone data the last two days and yes we did get scammed)

She was angry again and directed it towards her classmate, the climax was when she threw a shoe at her face from a meter away (luckily the dumb bitch has a terrible aim). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s constantly bringing up my money situation too. At one point she did this in front of strangers so I told her ‘hey HK is more expensive than taiwan and at least I travelled during the year - I purchased 4 return flights. And btw it’s not your place to pry into my finances, especially after you told me it’s ok if I want to keep a low budget’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we fought again because I’m spending time on google etc looking up things to do, planning the itinerary, transport, accommodation etc - all for her to tell me ‘nah I don’t like it’ and says we should just ‘ask someone’ about literally everything. Her carefree attitude has resulted in us getting scammed a total of 3 times so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time was because she wanted us to trust the shady guy selling phone cards right at the border, instead of going to a shop. 100rmb, gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was when she insisted that instead of taking a bus or other public transport to a location, we should definitely go to a travel agent to book a taxi for us - cost us triple the fare on the meter and he dropped us off 1.5km from the intended destination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, her and her classmate got a tour bus somewhere, and the driver only took them part way, requesting an additional 200rmb to finish the journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I pointed out that at least I’m doing some research instead of just complaining all the time
She tells me ‘you’re all talk and no action’ despite the fact that I’ve been leading us around everywhere to find things to do. She’s literally contributed nothing. Furthermore she told me I’m ruining the trip and she refuses to stick to my ‘cheap ass budget’ and eat in ‘shitty local canteens’ another day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off: she was at first supportive of the fact I need to budget tighter. Secondly, I’ve been taking her to local restaurants. When we were in Guangdong province I was already quite familiar with the local food due to having spent a year in Hong Kong and thought she’d appreciate it since were travelling. Finally, she’s routinely skipping meals only to snack on things like Oreos, waiting to go eat pizza and drink beer in bars later on. And she insists we take a taxi everywhere while kicking up a stink when I bought a metro card in Guangzhou for 50rmb to save buying singles everywhere and give us a little flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve ditched her now btw, but she’s still taking the moral high ground. She did this whole speech on our group chat about how she was ready to forgive me until I ‘patronised’ her about something. (Pointing our that ive had no phone data the last two days and yes we did get scammed) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m less than a week into this trip and I already wish I could go back to HK and spent a bit more time with my gf before I have to go home &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Wife finally came over and apologized for yelling at me.  Sorry sorry sorry.  I told her I'm done with the sorrys.  I've gotten over opiates, new job, completely transformed the property we live on (being free on opiates is a beautiful thing btw), aside from cannabis I dont spend any money on myself because I feel guilty when I do.

I told her I'd like to think ive changed immensely over the past 2 years and I see zero change in her.  If anything her bad habits have gotten much worse.  Example she took over the house payments after I got clean and let the house go into foreclosure AGAIN after I cleared it all up.  Her reason?  ""It just got outta hand"".  I found out because the mortgage company actually left a note on my door and after she lied about THAT I called and found out wtf was happening myself

I try so hard to be the glue that keeps us all together but I'm struggling hard here people.  I had no1 else to turn to vent so here I am.

Example she took over the house payments after I got clean and let the house go into foreclosure AGAIN after I cleared it all up.  Her reason?  &amp;quot;It just got outta hand&amp;quot;.  I found out because the mortgage company actually left a note on my door and after she lied about THAT I called and found out wtf was happening myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try so hard to be the glue that keeps us all together but I&amp;#39;m struggling hard here people.  I had no1 else to turn to vent so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.  It&amp;#39;s rare for me these days.  Getting choked up just typing that fact out.  Sux&lt;/p&gt;

tl;dr at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

I've been friends with my ex for years (longer than we dated) and he called me to tell me he may have a brain tumor. He has an appointment for additional tests today to confirm or not. I guess the idea of possibly being terminal put some things into perspective for him and he basically told me I was his first love and that no matter what happens he wants me to know that. He said that I helped him grow as a person and thanks me for never giving up on him when everyone else did. He said ""even if we don't get back together..."" he wants me to be happy because I deserve it for being kind, loving, patient, and earnest.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved him so much and it hurt when his addiction tore us apart. He has since rehabbed and finally had his life on track for the past couple of years. He's had other partners since me, but he said he's never been able to let go of the feelings for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wants to be with him if the results show that he is terminal just so he doesn't have to end his life alone. And knowing that he still has feelings for me, and that he regrets the way he treated me in our relationship, I don't want him to end life with that type of regret on his mind. My life would go on, and I could do whatever I wanted, but his might be ending; the very idea of it cuts like a knife.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was single, I wouldn't give it a second thought...but I'm in a relationship right now, albeit a tumultuous one. Part of me wants to get out of the current relationship and go spend the rest of my ex's life with him...and a small part of me wants to just get out of my current relationship, period.

&amp;#x200B;

Not really looking for advice, just needed to get it off my chest.

Note: Please be respectful to others and to me if you are going to reply, I will do the same.

I honestly disagree with the whole concept of ""pride month"", (I'm a Christian and disagree with homosexual beliefs in general but I'm not homophobic) It's your sexual preference, why should I be subject to hearing people boast about the fact that they are attracted to their own gender? Keep it to yourself. It isn't like I go around wearing a flag with a straight line on it yelling ""I'M STRAIGHT!"", It's ridiculous. I'm probably going to be targeted for saying this but I don't really care, it's R/venting for a reason. And again, it isn't like I hate people or even slightly dislike them just because they're homosexual, it just makes me uncomfortable when people bring it up, it's your sexual orientation, why do I need to know that? It's basically like going into a public place and telling everyone that you have a foot fetish, I don't want to hear that! And also I'd like to point out that I really don't like the fact that the homosexual flag is a rainbow because I for one love the rainbow but whenever I go out in public or to school with anything that resembles a rainbow, people assume that I'm homosexual and it annoys me because I enjoy the rainbow but feel uncomfortable when someone lables me as homosexual for it. Call me homophobic, I don't care, but I'm allowed to feel uncomfortable about something, which separates me from being homophobic, a homophobe is one that is intolerant of homosexuals and who targets them, insults them, etc. I honestly don't care that much if you're gay or not, I just don't want to talk about it like it's a normal thing to talk about, I feel as uncomfortable when one of my friends starts talking to me about how attractive a girl is, these aren't topics that should be discussed on a normal basis.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I realize that the title may look a bit agressive, I apologise for that.&lt;/p&gt;

Actually im not sure if he is trying to convince me or not, but from time to time he tells me and send sources for stuff like that

&amp;#x200B;

I like him a lot, we've been friends for a bit over 5 years now and he is literally the only friend I have in this town, but this is getting worse day by day, it feels like he is getting paranoid, yesterday he told me the technology is making people dumber and I could've argued but again I kept myself in silence.

I have some anxiety, it's 3am now and I can't stop thinking stuff to tell him later

(I probably will never tell, I just think a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared because I always thought it was just a joke for him or if it wasn't a joke, I thought he wasn't taking it so seriously.

But he indeed hates the government and thinks they are the bad guys hiding stuff from us. 

He thinks in a future only people with agricultural, hunting, fishing and skills like that will survive and he wants to be prepared to hunt, plant, cook and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like to argue, when he tells me something about flat earth I usually stay quiet and listen because I don't want him to get mad I simply respect and yeah. But as I said it's getting worse, I'm afraid, I never thought he would take it so seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it may be hard for him, it feels like he is scared. 

He doesn't accept my opinion, he respects what I say but always think I'm wrong.

He doesn't believes in the government so basically sending any government source or scientific source to him is a completely waste of time, he only believes in YouTube videos.

it feels like he thinks he is the only person who is right.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help him, he is my bestfriend and I'm sincerely scared.

After all of that crap (like 1 year after), M made an alt account to “spy” people. I didn’t even knew and I befriend him. M invited me to his server and blablabla. 

Finally he did another drama (in his server) saying what a good friend of mine is a pedophile, I say the truth and left that server.

Despite everyone telling us to wait to get married and that we were too young. On our wedding night our oldest son was conceived.
  9 months later I was in a war and she was in labor. Life was hard for us when I got back we both had separate issues we were dealing with and never handled well. 2 years later our youngest was born. I hated every minute I spent away from my family so I decided to get out and do something I wouldn't have to leave for weeks or months for anymore.
  1 year later I had a good job and everything seemed to be going perfectly until her she had a breakdown and decided she decided she wanted out. 3 months of hell on Earth for the both of us and we reconciled. I had lost my job and we both regretted everything that had happened. 
  I couldn't find work so we decided that I would stay home with the kids while she pursued her career. 2 years and another move halfway across the country; I still can't find a job but she tells me as long as I'm taking care of the kids and the house well make it work.

Despite everyone telling us to wait to get married and that we were too young. On our wedding night our oldest son was conceived.
  9 months later I was in a war and she was in labor. Life was hard for us when I got back we both had separate issues we were dealing with and never handled well. 2 years later our youngest was born. I hated every minute I spent away from my family so I decided to get out and do something I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to leave for weeks or months for anymore.
  1 year later I had a good job and everything seemed to be going perfectly until her she had a breakdown and decided she decided she wanted out. 3 months of hell on Earth for the both of us and we reconciled. I had lost my job and we both regretted everything that had happened. 
  I couldn&amp;#39;t find work so we decided that I would stay home with the kids while she pursued her career. 2 years and another move halfway across the country; I still can&amp;#39;t find a job but she tells me as long as I&amp;#39;m taking care of the kids and the house well make it work.

This alone is a disgusting statistic, but then to make the women who become pregnant as a result of their life-altering and traumatic experience keep that child is abhorrent. However, even in pregnancies that are not the result of a sexual assault, it should be unquestionably a womans choice whether or not she wants to enter into motherhood. A man's right to choose anything, regarding their bodies, is never questioned or argued against. The government allowing these restrictions to be put into action perpetuates the idea that women are less than men and are not allowed to have control over their own bodies or lives. Ironically, many of the same people who want to strip women of the choice to terminate a pregnancy are the same people who argue against social programs. This will create an atmosphere in which countless women will be forced into parenthood without the resources to sufficiently provide for that child. Additionally, welfare and the other social programs currently in place are not designed to allow single mothers to progress out of poverty.

Moreover, it is unjust to force others to conform to your personal or religious ideologies. If you do not personally feel it is right to have an abortion, do not have one. However, that does not give you the right to take that choice away from another woman.

So I dated a girl before leaving active duty overseas. We clicked pretty well and had a great time. Due to some paperwork getting messed up about me leaving, I kinda was left to the side and never processed to get out properly, leading me to have a 5 day notice that I will be discharged. (Honorably, nothing bad.) I was devastated that I had to leave her and promised to make it work. I was hoping to get a job overseas to see her again. 

Fast forward to getting back to the states. No job, hard to get one. IT isn't a really popular thing where I am from considering how rural my state is. No money whatsoever either (My fault.) I sold my leave and spend it all getting a car. Then take a delivery job to get by. I feel like shit and she immediately stops messaging me. Which didn't help my mood. I eventually land a couple contracting jobs and make good money, but she randomly blocked me out of nowhere, for seemingly no reason. Devastating me. I never got creepy, just made small talk and got updates on how she was doing whenever she did actually talk to me. 

Fast forward a year later, as I am travelling doing work for different bases. Pretty relaxing, trying to figure out what to do with myself while saving money. I don't move on and don't date, as I cant support a relationship travelling 100 percent. She hits me up out of the blue. I'm ecstatic. It really was a great thing to hear from her again. We share info and have a good time catching up. Eventually though, money came up. Her mother who paid for her college cut her off money wise so she couldn't afford to live in London while going to school. Following an argument about grades and tattoo's (Stereotypical older Asian conservative lady.) She was in debt fast and took a job. She was scraping by to make ends meet but it wasn't enough due to school or even the odd sick day.

She debated being a sugar baby and seeing wealthy men for money, like, dinners and stuff. But I was against it obviously, having feelings still going strong. I offer to help her out, no strings attached as I was worried other men would use that dependence to take advantage of her. I wouldn't ask for a single thing. This was a mistake. 

She visited family after taking a month off of work in December 2018. Her mother paid for the trip back but not for her missing work, and made her work at the company she owns. I covered her bills more than the usual. I did my best and got her through. Going into 2019 about January and February, she was already planning on seeing her family again, without her mothers help. She wanted it so bad but wouldn't let me pay for it. I told her to reconcile with her mother. She eventually said it worked and went there. 

So.. She slowed talking to me, and even blocked me on the flight over. Only to re add me later. She lost her job by taking time off again without notice. 

Turns out later she agreed to have sex with a person she knew back home for the flight and living money. So I would imagine she took an easy way out so she didn't have to work? She lied to me about it and kept it from me until he cut her off because she was talking to other guys. They had an agreement for him to have access to her FB account, make sure she was talking to no men, and have sex with him every 3 months. 

I was devastated. Absolutely destroyed as I was having suspicions but didn't want to believe. I had lost my job at that time due to a contract being cancelled and was worried about finding another one to support her. She said that it wasn't a bad deal for her, and that she wanted me to spend money on myself and not burden me anymore but I don't believe it. 

Now she is in debt again, as her current internship at a company doesn't pay well, she hates the work she has gone to college for (she is about to start her last year.) and owes her friends about 3.5k USD for helping her, not including me. She told me already she has no intention of dating due to not being in a good spot and refuses to talk about possible paths she could take for other careers and stuff. 

I unfortunately agreed to help again. She either gets money from me, or will have to use her body to get the money to pay her friends back and I cant in good conscious just break it off even though my brain is screaming and I am under stress now. We argue now allot as well. Though I feel dragged along emotionally a bit when she says she wants us to be able to meet and stuff when we are in better positions in life.

This has turned me into a person I never thought I was. I want her to be safe, I love her but after spending so much money I just feel used and not valued. Like I don't matter. Its hard to want to help without expecting something in return, as that is the right thing to do for someone you love and care for, but its just a bad deal as we aren't dating and I am getting nothing in return, not even a phone conversation as she is uncomfortable with it (Though sleeping with people for money is fine? Logic...). 

I moved to LA from the east coast out of pocket and work for good pay. Still recovering from the move. I can afford it with my monthly expenses considered... but I will have to do without allot of things again. This is taking such a big toll on me.

I have two choices. Give up so much of my money and free time to work and pay for her debt, to prevent her from potentially going down a path of harm..

Or look after myself, cut ties here and be able to save and do whatever I want at the cost of me knowing what life she will have to live because of that.

Previously I was young enough to be living with my parents and be helped by them. Now I have rent to pay. I have a full time job. But I have to survive. How can I make money and not have to eat?? Fuck. I really wish I could just inject calories and energy into myself and not have to eat. It hurts. It physically hurts. And I feel so sick. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that I&amp;#39;ve got gastroparesis or something... I&amp;#39;ve been having bouts of not being able to eat without nausea and pain for most of my life. My bowel doesn&amp;#39;t work for weeks at a time. I have to take something for that. When I am able to go, the pain is insane. I almost passed out last night. My lips are tingling. My sides hurt. I never am able to throw up. It just feels awful for days at a time until my stomach finally gurgles and I feel it start to drain. I&amp;#39;ve had to press on my abdomen and manually move things around for relief. I am so tired. I am so nauseous. I am so scared. I don&amp;#39;t want to die. But when I go to the doctor, &amp;quot;nothing is causing it.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve never been tested for gastroparesis, looking back on it,  I have no fucking clue why. They did a barrium swallow and tilt test. They did an endoscopy and took tissue samples. But never bothered to connect my nausea and chronic constipation and difficulty swallowing. I didn&amp;#39;t know gastroparesis was a thing until about a year ago. Maybe that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve had trouble swallowing pills and food??? For fucks sake. Doctors are so quick to say that you&amp;#39;re paranoid. I am in real genuine pain. I have missed out on SO MUCH OF MY LIFE being sick. I&amp;#39;ve been judged by teachers and shunned by friends. I&amp;#39;ve had employers tell me that my illness is really inconvenient for them. Like. If you think it&amp;#39;s annoying for you... stop and think. How the fuck do you think I feel???? I WANT to work. I WANT to be able to go to work and feel 100% okay. My pain and suffering is inconvenient for you? Fucking really? I am so tired. I almost want to just give up. May as well just let myself starve. Uh oh. But then they&amp;#39;ll call me anorexic! Middle school flashbacks. Nothing is more confusing as a young teen than having the guidance counsellor tell you that you have an eating disorder when you don&amp;#39;t. I want to eat. I really do. It&amp;#39;s just not worth what I feel like afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

My family is a whole big clusterfuck. My parents divorced when I was 12, and my mom has moved around a lot since then. My dad took the separation very harshly, and turned into a completely different person. Very verbally and emotionally abusive. When he got a girlfriend we all moved in together and it got worse. She had a daughter who was an absolute brat, the golden child. My dad nitpicked everything me and my siblings did. Nothing was ever right, he basically wanted us to be robots with no personality. He was controlling, I couldn't have a cellphone, or a drivers liscense. I moved out as soon as I graduated high school. I moved 4 hours away, to live with my mom. 

It was really great for the first few weeks. But I started to suffer from crippling loneliness. I was already suffering from depression through all of this beforehand. But being away from all of my friends and never being able to leave the house because of my lack of liscense, left me feeling completely alone. After about 4 months of fighting suicidal thoughts, I got a job. And that helped the loneliness. During that time, a long time friend of mine confessed to me, and we began dating. Everything seemed to be going great. He lived 4 hours away but we visited each other when we could. I still didnt have my liscense but I was working on it. 

Soon after I started working, my mother's boyfriend moved in, and things instantly went downhill. He was extremely entitled, selfish and a complete child. I had been paying half of the rent to help out my mother, but suddenly I had to pay half of the bills. I was giving them over half my check every payday. I was struggling to save money. Anything I needed for myself, I bought. Which was fine, but i wasnt even allowed to eat the groceries I helped buy anymore. I had to buy my own separate food. And laundry detergent, even my own toilet paper. It was ridiculous. Suddenly they couldn't buy their own cigarettes or didnt have enough money for gas. And my mother was constantly asking me for money. 

I lived like this for 2 years. During this time we moved 3 times. I had gotten my drivers permit, but I couldnt find the time to practice. I worked nights, and my shifts were always unpredictable. I worked anywhere from 8-16 hours a day. It was exhausting, and I never got enough sleep. I had a very good relationship with my mother before all of this. Towards the end of the 2 years, we hardly talked, and when we did, I stood there quietly as she told me I never did enough, never gave enough and didn't understand how hard she worked. I held a steady job for 2 years, while her and her boyfriend job jumped. 

I eventually was so emotionally exhausted from it all that I called my father crying (I'd only spoken to him a handful of times over the past 2 years) asking if I could come back. So I quit my job, and left my mother's house. Now I'm jobless and still liscenseless. My dad has been better, but I think it's because his health is failing him and hes realized hes been a complete asshole to his children for a long time.

I get that discipline is used to make sure your kids grow up acting mature and know the difference between right and wrong but I honestly hate when some parents take it too far. What I see appropriate for discipline is taking things away and giving them back after a certain period, a slap on the wrist, or a lecture. But I just honestly hate how parents will smack their kid across the head, telling them how their fucking stupid and they should feel bad for what they did, and just making them feel horrible entirely. I get that some families would use a shoe or a wooden spoon to which I understand that but just beating your kid up isn't what I view discipline to be. I don't view it as an excuse to tell your kid how their stupid, nobody should like them, and just hurting them on the inside. This is why there's some people with low self esteem because of things like this, including me, and struggle to find a reason to try and look their best. Parents shouldn't be talking shit to their kids and complaining about them to their face. I understand that some parents would say ""You shouldn't do that because its bad and you'll be bad if you do it"" and other terms but its just ridiculous that people would do that. But I don't want to set a view point by saying ""Be easy on your kids"" because if you do then they'll become unruly and mostly entitled. But mental and/or emotional abuse shouldn't be the route parents should take.

Just stop calling your kids worthless, stupid, idiots, etc.

Because that ends up sticking to them and might drive them to do things they don't want to be doing

But mental and/or emotional abuse shouldn&amp;#39;t be the route parents should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just stop calling your kids worthless, stupid, idiots, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that ends up sticking to them and might drive them to do things they don&amp;#39;t want to be doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my words are useless and people go against this then I&amp;#39;ll delete it by all means&lt;/p&gt;

Since I lost my dad, maternal grandma, and paternal great-grandma \[all in which I was very close to\] I haven't really had a passion for life. I have asked for death numerous of times but my other family members have prayed that I stay here. I died during a diabetic coma and their prayers are what brought me back alive, or God's plan for me. Yet I still don't know my purpose nor how to find it. I am a people pleaser and often made my major life choices off what my paternal grandparents in addition to the extreme anxiety I get when making major life decisions. I dislike making decisions and always have to consult with someone for advice that I probably should have made on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Emotional support is not helping me right now and I'm thinking that might be why it's so hard for me to love my boyfriend \[29/M\]. He is everything I could've asked for but he's a complete asshole. His remarks are sarcastic pieces of advice that I'm supposed to cypher through and pull the big picture from. But with my anxiety, it just feels like he's nagging or pointing it out because he wants me to be a certain way. He's been trying to help me overcome my depression and anxiety - often use marijuana to medicate and it helps until my high comes down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I run to my paternal grandmother about everything because she raised me since I was a baby. No matter who I explain my situation to though, they always insist that I just leave, work on me, and start over. I mean I have no ties to my bf - no children of my own(just his 2 daughters), no proposal/marriage - but I just want to do better with him. I'm looking at the potential of my partner - he's a loving provider, smart, and shows me unconditional love - but for some reason I'm not gaining happy weight or nothing to show that I'm happy with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck at a standstill with my heart and my mind. It doesn't make it any better that my spiritman isn't giving me any guidance. I pray faithfully, especially about my relationship, and yet still no answers and still turmoil in my home. By turmoil I mean, miscommunication, my bf feeling like he doesn't fulfill me, my family not supporting my partner and I, trying to satisfy my bf and fix everything he's pointed out to me, financial problems from living above our means with no faith in my partner that he can provide for me. I try to pay every bill and leave him some money in his pocket because he has children with needs (bm sending kids with no clothes just so we can buy her some, school events that we dont learn about until last minute, etc). I feel like I'm stressing myself trying to keep our home afloat through his up-and-down employment. I want him to be my husband and granted I have crybaby tendencies (I cry about everything before I get headstrong and be pro-active), getting frustrated when he tells me about myself (accepting his positive criticism), and problems uplifting my man so he can feel better when he goes out in the world. We will be together for 4 years in November and I just don't want to throw it away. Maybe I'm not meant for a relationship and I've brought this to his attention as well but he will not let me go. He wants US to work on me together I guess. It just feels like we'll be better off without each other (he deserves better than me and I need time to heal).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm venting but I am open to support and opinions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I [25/F]am Depression fighter currently still in the battle. Since I lost my dad, maternal grandma, and paternal great-grandma [all in which I was very close to] I haven&amp;#39;t really had a passion for life. I have asked for death numerous of times but my other family members have prayed that I stay here. I died during a diabetic coma and their prayers are what brought me back alive, or God&amp;#39;s plan for me. Yet I still don&amp;#39;t know my purpose nor how to find it. I am a people pleaser and often made my major life choices off what my paternal grandparents in addition to the extreme anxiety I get when making major life decisions. I dislike making decisions and always have to consult with someone for advice that I probably should have made on my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotional support is not helping me right now and I&amp;#39;m thinking that might be why it&amp;#39;s so hard for me to love my boyfriend [29/M]. He is everything I could&amp;#39;ve asked for but he&amp;#39;s a complete asshole. His remarks are sarcastic pieces of advice that I&amp;#39;m supposed to cypher through and pull the big picture from. But with my anxiety, it just feels like he&amp;#39;s nagging or pointing it out because he wants me to be a certain way. He&amp;#39;s been trying to help me overcome my depression and anxiety - often use marijuana to medicate and it helps until my high comes down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run to my paternal grandmother about everything because she raised me since I was a baby. No matter who I explain my situation to though, they always insist that I just leave, work on me, and start over. I mean I have no ties to my bf - no children of my own(just his 2 daughters), no proposal/marriage - but I just want to do better with him. I&amp;#39;m looking at the potential of my partner - he&amp;#39;s a loving provider, smart, and shows me unconditional love - but for some reason I&amp;#39;m not gaining happy weight or nothing to show that I&amp;#39;m happy with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m stuck at a standstill with my heart and my mind. It doesn&amp;#39;t make it any better that my spiritman isn&amp;#39;t giving me any guidance. I pray faithfully, especially about my relationship, and yet still no answers and still turmoil in my home. By turmoil I mean, miscommunication, my bf feeling like he doesn&amp;#39;t fulfill me, my family not supporting my partner and I, trying to satisfy my bf and fix everything he&amp;#39;s pointed out to me, financial problems from living above our means with no faith in my partner that he can provide for me.

About two and a half months back my son's mother with screwed over by her roommate and had to look for a place with a window of time of only about a week and a half. We legitimately found a place the day before she was being forced to move. During that time frame, one of my family members found out they'd been approved for a home loan and started looking into real estate. They have mobility issues and fpr the most part I'm their caretaker. On top of that, I have majority custody of our six-year-old son due to the fact that his mother works during the day and he is on the Spectrum. She has zero patience when it comes to his meltdowns and can be an even bigger pain in the ass than he ever was.

I'm going to be all over the place, venting because this is honestly getting to be too damn much. Two years ago she did some incredibly unforgivable shit. She turned into an incredibly manipulative person, played head games with me, and it made me feel guilty on a daily basis due to the fact I'd been injured on the job suffering nerve damage in my leg and had been repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying for disability.

During this period of time I was a stay-at-home dad. I've been raising our son since he was 10 months old. And towards the end of the relationship she would go out of her way to remind me that I was garbage in her own special ways. She would allow her severely bipolar mother to belittle me in front of our son and she'd even join in from time to time. So when I found out she'd been cheating on me in the process, I was crushed but not surprised. We'd been broken up 4 weeks and she slipped up and told me she was six weeks pregnant. The only comfort I took in this news was knowing that she had put me in such a state of depression that I couldn't even bring myself to be intimate with her towards the end.

So Flash Forward to present day, for the sake of my sanity in the sake of my son's mental well-being, I did my best to put the negativity to the side. I'm still attempting to do so.

The baby's dad is in one of these on-again-off-again kind of relationships with her and barely sees his son unless it's convenient for him. Due to the fact that again, she works during the day time, she pays me $80 a week to watch the baby.

The Silver Lining is that he gets to spend time with his brother. But that's about all.

I'm only making about $320 a month. I'm 37, still living with family, and I feel like the biggest fucking failure on the face of the planet. Despite being medicated for my depression, anxiety, and PTSD, I feel like I'm drowning.

I talked to my family about my problems and it's like they still see me as a seven-year-old kid. I tried talking to my friends, and it feels like, at least to me, they've heard this so much recently, I've become nothing more than a burden to them.

And just when things start to look up, reality reminds me that is a house of cards built in a wind tunnel. As soon as I start smiling, somebody turns on the fan. To the point we're I'm legitimately afraid of even feeling the slightest tinge of happiness. I haven't been this low since between 2011 and 2015 where in which my ex and I had a stillbirth and my mother passed away. I was in counseling, but lost my medical insurance.

I've worked for my company for years. I started out as reception like alot of the other girls and then finally worked my way up to a project manager assistant position! I was so thrilled and super happy. I got a big raise , and the job I wanted to do and knew I could do a great job in. 

What started out so great turned into a nightmare. Everyday is hell... The girls in the office that were once nice to me started to gang up on me. Mean comments, gossip, to the point I would go home and cry myself to sleep. I didn't know why they stopped being nice to me but then i realized.. I have been doing more work then them, i'm being praised for a good job. I even took the time to go to the warehouse and make sure my stuff would ship out on time to customers, make sure my stock was there and correctly counted ( we don't have the best system), coordinate with the staff in shipping.

 Apparently one of the girls in the office didn't like this. She told upper management I was going back there to smoke and talk a whole day. So upper management told me never to go back there.. It got to the point upper management even poked fun at me, telling me they should ""tether me to my desk"". It's extremely stressful trying to do my work everyday. i've been doing a great job and i know i have but everything is changed.. It's different. 

The place I once loved to be at I now dread going to everyday. I thought it would be a good idea to tell upper HR. That was a bad idea.. I've noticed no one is talking to me now. And i over heard the president of the company on the phone saying to ""hire the new person right away and get rid of this girl"". I was supposed to have my annual review ( that never happened and that was supposed to happen months ago). I was very sick and had to have surgery.. They docked my pay. Said I can't use a vacation day as a sick day.. And my three sick days were all used up.

I'm trying to keep it together. I have done nothing but good at this company. I've gotten them better discounts on items, made good relationships with new vendors, order all my stuff on time, complete my orders on time.. But no matter what I do it is never good enough. I'm always talked about , I always have to watch every corner I turn, I'm sick of it. 

This place is making me emotionally and physically ill. I don'y even know how I get by everyday there. I'm either going to find a new job or this place is going to kill me. 

Feels better that i'm getting this all out. Any advice would help. I don't know if i'm just crazy and this is normal at a work place. But either way it's making me sick.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where should i start off? I&amp;#39;ve worked for my company for years. I started out as reception like alot of the other girls and then finally worked my way up to a project manager assistant position! I was so thrilled and super happy. I got a big raise , and the job I wanted to do and knew I could do a great job in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started out so great turned into a nightmare. Everyday is hell... The girls in the office that were once nice to me started to gang up on me. Mean comments, gossip, to the point I would go home and cry myself to sleep. I didn&amp;#39;t know why they stopped being nice to me but then i realized.. I have been doing more work then them, i&amp;#39;m being praised for a good job. I even took the time to go to the warehouse and make sure my stuff would ship out on time to customers, make sure my stock was there and correctly counted ( we don&amp;#39;t have the best system), coordinate with the staff in shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently one of the girls in the office didn&amp;#39;t like this. She told upper management I was going back there to smoke and talk a whole day. So upper management told me never to go back there.. It got to the point upper management even poked fun at me, telling me they should &amp;quot;tether me to my desk&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s extremely stressful trying to do my work everyday. i&amp;#39;ve been doing a great job and i know i have but everything is changed.. It&amp;#39;s different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place I once loved to be at I now dread going to everyday. I thought it would be a good idea to tell upper HR. That was a bad idea.. I&amp;#39;ve noticed no one is talking to me now. And i over heard the president of the company on the phone saying to &amp;quot;hire the new person right away and get rid of this girl&amp;quot;. I was supposed to have my annual review ( that never happened and that was supposed to happen months ago). I was very sick and had to have surgery.. They docked my pay. Said I can&amp;#39;t use a vacation day as a sick day.. And my three sick days were all used up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to keep it together. I have done nothing but good at this company. I&amp;#39;ve gotten them better discounts on items, made good relationships with new vendors, order all my stuff on time, complete my orders on time.. But no matter what I do it is never good enough. I&amp;#39;m always talked about , I always have to watch every corner I turn, I&amp;#39;m sick of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place is making me emotionally and physically ill. I don&amp;#39;y even know how I get by everyday there. I&amp;#39;m either going to find a new job or this place is going to kill me. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm here with X (my older brother), Rex (family dog), and Limbo (family cat). Names have been changed: events have not.

So one thing my mom does to keep our busy family on track is cheat a huge monthly calendar on a dry erase board so that we can all fill in our schedules and know where we are if we are needed. Due to family getting old, my immediate family wanted to go up to see them. My brother and I are working this whole weekend and couldn't get off so we stayed home to look after the house and take care of the family pets.

Just a bit of information: I just completed my first year of college and my brother, while he stayed home to work instead of move out or go to college, is also a full grown adult.

My parents left Friday afternoon while we were both at work, so day one is Saturday.



DAY ONE:

We both have work at 9 am and since I've competed with him and my little sister for the bathroom once before in the morning, I know that enough that I need to get up as early as possible in order to get a shower in and take care of the rest of my morning duties.

I know well enough that my brother will be running late and not think twice about taking care of our pets, so I chop up my dogs wet food, take him out for the bathroom, and take care of the cat. 

That's when I hear the pipes spring to life: he's jumped into the shower. This wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't routinely late for work by waking up late (even with afternoon shifts) then insisting on taking showers that last well over an hour. 

I take my chances and knock on the door.

After six ""what""s and two ""I can't hear you""s, (I can't stand repeating myself and he wanted me to scream over his shower rather than make a single attempt to hear me better) he finally got the message that he needed to hurry.

He left the bathroom at 8:47, giving me less time than it takes to get to my work to use the bathroom.

And you might be asking why I didn't just leave. At this point I had accepted that the shower was a lost cause and my co-workers and customer service job was going to have to deal with that. I couldn't leave, however, because my toothbrush, deoderant, hairbrush, and  (gross enough) my pads were in the bathroom behind a door that is held shut by and open drawer on the other side (the door doesn't shut and opens on it's own, so to keep it shut, we open a sink drawer right up beside it).

DAY ONE (EVENING)

I made it to work late, but still made it. I had been there for almost the full day (closing in on 5 pm) when I get a text from my brother asking why I had yet to let the dog out. Apparently he pooped on the floor and my brother, who had been home at the time (gets off before me), discovered it and blamed me even though I was the only one to bother taking care of him in the morning and even though I was still at work.

You're right. My bad.

I'm so stressed and annoyed with my brother that my boyfriend picks me up from work, grabs us pasta for dinner and my favorite flavor of cookies in a family sized box (IMPORTANT) for us to destress and enjoy.

I get home and start making dinner for my boyfriend and I. 

My brother is hovering the whole time and it hits me that he's expecting me to be making dinner for him too. WTF? Begrudgingly (as to not start a conflict on day one), I comply and not only start making him his own pasta, but also throw in my dinosaur chicken nuggets that I was saving for a rainy day and my pizza pockets in order to have enough food to satisfy him so that he wouldn't be tempted to start taking ours. I cut up the dogs wet food and serve it to him as I did in the morning and text my brother that dinner is done.

My boyfriend and I grab 2 cookies each out of the box (planning to spread them out over the week so that we have something to help destress ourselves) and go to curl up on the couch to watch HGTV. My brother, who had gone upstairs to lay on his tablet because the process of cooking took too long, didn't come downstairs for his food for roughly two hours, making it impossible for me to do dishes and leaving me too tired (I got off at 8 and relaxed a bit before making dinner so it was almost 11:30 pm) to clean up anything after he was done. This made me resort to leaving the kitchen trashed and going to bed, knowing I'd have to suffer the consequences tomorrow.


DAY TWO


I get up early again. I don't go in until late but I still get up at  around 8 to make sure the pets are taken care of and to attempt to take care of the kitchen (can't expect my brother to have pitched in at all). I take the dog out, clean the litter box, and feed the animals. 

Since I'm in my schools honors college, I have some extra work (not related to any classes) that I have to do over the summer that is due on June 1st that I have been putting off because it's bs. Tuesday will be my only day off since two weeks ago and is my only day off until next Monday. While I was planning on doing it all Tues, this weekend has drained me enough that I decided that I really needed that day off. 

Instead of doing the dishes, I am doing college work until about 10:30-11 o'clock. I see that my brother doesn't have work until 12 and I have heard him moving yet (even if he is up, he doesn't get out of bed unless it is to change out from playing on his tablet to playing on one of our consoles) so I decide that I should hop in and get ready before work like I couldn't do yesterday. 

I get out around 11:30 after finishing literally everything to find my brother standing outside the bathroom door, clothes in hand. He hadn't even knocked once but figured that I'd telepathically sense that he was out there and get out of the bathroom so that he could get ready for work. Apparently he had been standing out there like that since I started the shower. 

He insists that I have left him with (checks his clock) less than an hour to get ready and pushes past me. I go downstairs to take the dog out again and to make a little more headway on my work. 

My brother leaves for work and immediately texts me that he won't be back until 7:30 pm and that Rex is mine too take care of until he gets back (presumably his way of saying ""don't let me find did shit again). I text him that I don't get off until 8 pm again so that, really, Rex is his responsibility until I get home.

I leave for work at 2 and I don't hear anything from him. Instead of going out with my boyfriend's family like I had planned to do over a week ago, I go home to take care of the animals because I can't trust that he's done anything I haven't directly asked him to do.

DAY TWO (EVENING)

I come home to untouched dishes, unfilled food bowls, and, the icing on the cake, my cookie box completely empty. MY FUCKING FAMILY SIZED BOX OF COOKIES. FIVE ROWS. GONE.

I fucking call him out on it and he laughs, saying that he only ate 3 rows after work and he had eaten the rest while my boyfriend and I were watching HGTV. ""They were just there and begging to be eaten.""

I text mom and she says that she hides her stuff so he doesn't eat it (aka: she avoids dealing with his fucking bad habits of expecting everything in this world to be set up for him). She follows it up by saying it's probably the only meal he's eaten today.

HE HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO EAT BREAKFAST. **HE WORKS AT A GODDAMNED GROCERY STORE**. You're trying to tell me that this full grown man child is incapable of finding his own food and taking basic care of himself?

I'm so pissed. I take care of the pets the best I can, I do all the dishes in the house (while he stares at me and pulls out a cup from the cupboard even though he already has three cups from today) and proceeds to drink and stand directly in the way of me.

I can't take it anymore. I call my boyfriend to come get me. I'm too pissed to drive. I leave him with one duty: feed the dog before you leave to play DND with your friends. 

He tells me, right before I walk out the door, that the ac turned off upstairs. Instead of fixing it with the mechanism right outside his door, he opened every window upstairs. Mind you, my screen is broken and any time my windows get opened all sorts of ants, stink bugs, spiders, and critter crawl their way into my room. Not to mention that wasps have decided that the roof right above my bedroom window is the perfect place to nest.

We live in the south and so, more often than not, the outside air is unbearably hot and leaving them shut would be the better alternative. I'm so pissed that I can't deal with it and leave with my boyfriend. 

I come back at nearly midnight and see that he is nowhere to be seen. Instead of run around to close all the windows, I take the L and pass out in 90 degree heat. I am tired and have work in the morning.

DAY THREE: **TODAY**

I woke up at 5 am due to a nightmare (a nightly thing. I'm super stressed all the time and the events of the past two days have been taking their toll) and I am parched af due to the sweltering heat. 

I hear the toilet softly flushing upstairs and assume that X got up not long ago to use the bathroom and the bowl was just refilling. I pass by it and go down to the kitchen where I get a drink. I think it's weird how loud the water pipes are being in the walls but try to reason them as normal volumed, just loud in the stillness of the morning. I use the bathroom just off the kitchen because I suddenly have to pee and once I exit the bathroom, I notice that the pipes are still running.

Now, I'm scared of the dark and have a lot of anxieties about opening doors at night for fear of what's behind them, but I know that something is wrong so I work up the courage to check it out.

The toilet is flushing. It's probably been flushing softly all night. It's like, stuck end flush where the bowl is still trying to refill so it isn't loud af, but it isn't overflowing. 

I am PISSED. This asshole decided to use the bathroom (probably whenever he got home last night), realized that the toilet wasn't stopping flushing, and decided to just go tf to bed instead of dealing with it. I turned off the water and turned it back on, fixing the problem and promptly jumped on Reddit to vent. My parents should be coming home today and I have asked him to do me one favor and unload the dishwasher and turn on the roomba while I'm at work. I work all morning and probably won't be off shift until they are back and he doesn't work until late afternoon. We will see if he fucking helped out around here.

Sorry, I realize this is long but I really needed to talk to someone who would see the absolute bs that has been the past couple days for me; clearly my mom won't.

The icing on the cake is that this isn't just some plot to make me miserable without mom being home. When I came home from college, mom was nice enough to wash all of the towels and generally straighten up the bathroom (neither my little sister (middle school) nor X bothered to do since last summer when it was so out of control that I cleaned it). This meant that we had to realize that our towel was gone and grab a new one.

My little sister and I realized and grabbed a new one. **MY OLDER BROTHER DECIDED TO JUST USE MINE**. He continued to use mine for a whole two weeks before I noticed. I thought it was weird that, no matter how long I waited to shower, my towel was always suspiciously wet before I realized that there were only 2 towel in the bathroom. 

THIS ISNT THE FIRST TIME ITS HAPPENED. It ALWAYS happens when mom is nice enough to clear out the towels in the bathroom to wash them. I grabbed a new towel, letting him have mine, and both my little sister and I bitched to my mom about it (as we do every time) and she ignored.

FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT. I hate being at college with all of my heart. I'm bored out of my mind there and I am paying a lot of money to not learn anything in my classes (yes I know that ""that's how it is first year"" but I've even tried taking a 300 level class in my major and was still bored and ended with an A). But I still can't wait to go back and be away from this absolute crap. At least none of the roommates I've had are this fucking obnoxious.

TDLR my older brother is an overgrown man child that would rather make my life a living hell than sustain himself for one weekend.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not really alone.

&lt;p&gt;He insists that I have left him with (checks his clock) less than an hour to get ready and pushes past me. I go downstairs to take the dog out again and to make a little more headway on my work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother leaves for work and immediately texts me that he won&amp;#39;t be back until 7:30 pm and that Rex is mine too take care of until he gets back (presumably his way of saying &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let me find did shit again). I text him that I don&amp;#39;t get off until 8 pm again so that, really, Rex is his responsibility until I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave for work at 2 and I don&amp;#39;t hear anything from him. Instead of going out with my boyfriend&amp;#39;s family like I had planned to do over a week ago, I go home to take care of the animals because I can&amp;#39;t trust that he&amp;#39;s done anything I haven&amp;#39;t directly asked him to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY TWO (EVENING)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come home to untouched dishes, unfilled food bowls, and, the icing on the cake, my cookie box completely empty. MY FUCKING FAMILY SIZED BOX OF COOKIES. FIVE ROWS. GONE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking call him out on it and he laughs, saying that he only ate 3 rows after work and he had eaten the rest while my boyfriend and I were watching HGTV. &amp;quot;They were just there and begging to be eaten.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I text mom and she says that she hides her stuff so he doesn&amp;#39;t eat it (aka: she avoids dealing with his fucking bad habits of expecting everything in this world to be set up for him). She follows it up by saying it&amp;#39;s probably the only meal he&amp;#39;s eaten today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HE HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO EAT BREAKFAST. &lt;strong&gt;HE WORKS AT A GODDAMNED GROCERY STORE&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;#39;re trying to tell me that this full grown man child is incapable of finding his own food and taking basic care of himself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so pissed. I take care of the pets the best I can, I do all the dishes in the house (while he stares at me and pulls out a cup from the cupboard even though he already has three cups from today) and proceeds to drink and stand directly in the way of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I call my boyfriend to come get me. I&amp;#39;m too pissed to drive. I leave him with one duty: feed the dog before you leave to play DND with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tells me, right before I walk out the door, that the ac turned off upstairs. Instead of fixing it with the mechanism right outside his door, he opened every window upstairs. Mind you, my screen is broken and any time my windows get opened all sorts of ants, stink bugs, spiders, and critter crawl their way into my room. Not to mention that wasps have decided that the roof right above my bedroom window is the perfect place to nest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in the south and so, more often than not, the outside air is unbearably hot and leaving them shut would be the better alternative. I&amp;#39;m so pissed that I can&amp;#39;t deal with it and leave with my boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come back at nearly midnight and see that he is nowhere to be seen. Instead of run around to close all the windows, I take the L and pass out in 90 degree heat. I am tired and have work in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY THREE: &lt;strong&gt;TODAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 5 am due to a nightmare (a nightly thing. I&amp;#39;m super stressed all the time and the events of the past two days have been taking their toll) and I am parched af due to the sweltering heat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear the toilet softly flushing upstairs and assume that X got up not long ago to use the bathroom and the bowl was just refilling. I pass by it and go down to the kitchen where I get a drink. I think it&amp;#39;s weird how loud the water pipes are being in the walls but try to reason them as normal volumed, just loud in the stillness of the morning. I use the bathroom just off the kitchen because I suddenly have to pee and once I exit the bathroom, I notice that the pipes are still running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m scared of the dark and have a lot of anxieties about opening doors at night for fear of what&amp;#39;s behind them, but I know that something is wrong so I work up the courage to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toilet is flushing. It&amp;#39;s probably been flushing softly all night. It&amp;#39;s like, stuck end flush where the bowl is still trying to refill so it isn&amp;#39;t loud af, but it isn&amp;#39;t overflowing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am PISSED. This asshole decided to use the bathroom (probably whenever he got home last night), realized that the toilet wasn&amp;#39;t stopping flushing, and decided to just go tf to bed instead of dealing with it. I turned off the water and turned it back on, fixing the problem and promptly jumped on Reddit to vent. My parents should be coming home today and I have asked him to do me one favor and unload the dishwasher and turn on the roomba while I&amp;#39;m at work. I work all morning and probably won&amp;#39;t be off shift until they are back and he doesn&amp;#39;t work until late afternoon. We will see if he fucking helped out around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I realize this is long but I really needed to talk to someone who would see the absolute bs that has been the past couple days for me; clearly my mom won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake is that this isn&amp;#39;t just some plot to make me miserable without mom being home. When I came home from college, mom was nice enough to wash all of the towels and generally straighten up the bathroom (neither my little sister (middle school) nor X bothered to do since last summer when it was so out of control that I cleaned it). This meant that we had to realize that our towel was gone and grab a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little sister and I realized and grabbed a new one. &lt;strong&gt;MY OLDER BROTHER DECIDED TO JUST USE MINE&lt;/strong&gt;. He continued to use mine for a whole two weeks before I noticed. I thought it was weird that, no matter how long I waited to shower, my towel was always suspiciously wet before I realized that there were only 2 towel in the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS ISNT THE FIRST TIME ITS HAPPENED. It ALWAYS happens when mom is nice enough to clear out the towels in the bathroom to wash them. I grabbed a new towel, letting him have mine, and both my little sister and I bitched to my mom about it (as we do every time) and she ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT. I hate being at college with all of my heart. I&amp;#39;m bored out of my mind there and I am paying a lot of money to not learn anything in my classes (yes I know that &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s how it is first year&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;ve even tried taking a 300 level class in my major and was still bored and ended with an A). But I still can&amp;#39;t wait to go back and be away from this absolute crap. At least none of the roommates I&amp;#39;ve had are this fucking obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDLR my older brother is an overgrown man child that would rather make my life a living hell than sustain himself for one weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

She&amp;#39;s had a lot of people walk away from her, she&amp;#39;s pretty clingy, and I can see why she wouldn&amp;#39;t want to hurt me like that. And now I&amp;#39;m afraid that if I ask I&amp;#39;ll be pushed away, which I don&amp;#39;t want. I&amp;#39;m cool with being platonic as long as she&amp;#39;s honest as to why we&amp;#39;re platonic, y&amp;#39;know?&lt;/p&gt;

I should have known something was up when all of a sudden at 9 at night my wife that hates going out after getting home from work. Randomly has to rush out to get some milk for the next morning when we have half a gallon left. 

Then the next day she talking about these fucking people are now going to a drag show. So she spends all day today out shopping for tiny dresses and new bras with some sad fucking excuses for needing a new black dress for a drag show and new bra. She never takes her clothes off much less her fucking bra in front of me or the kids, but strangely today she was basically naked getting changed and ready to go meet up with this group of randoms.

The baby wanted to say goodbye to her as she was leaving but you know moms. They have to go get that dick right fucking now. So I'm chasing mom out with a crying 3 year old in toe to tell her the baby wants a hug good bye. Then baby says I'll go in with daddy. As per the norm the baby watches mom EVERYDAY leave from the front window. It was like not even 45 seconds to get inside and to the window and mom was history and I could see her around the corner leaving at high speed.

Fast forward. She said intros and shit was happening between 7 and 9. Well at 845 I messaged her and told her we needed to talk asap it's about the baby. Per the norm she sees the text. I called 3 times at 910 915 and 930. No answer.

Well guess it must be nice fucking randoms in the fucking hot tub. This marriage is a fucking joke and has been for the past 6 years after she graduated college and forced me to be the stay at home dad and forced me to work nights and stay awake all day. Refusing to be any kind of intimate. Now she wants a third baby. Well I guess I know why she needed that fucking milk so bad.

Without tailoring on the details too much... but I had two ‘friends’ who I used to let walk over me because I felt sorry for how shitty their life was which lead them to develop mental problems such as depression and yeah.. yeah I know, I shouldn’t base any form of relationship on sympathy but I did also very much love and cared about them.. so for 8+ years I tried my best to always be there for them because hell knows what bs they’ll pin on you if you missed out on ‘being there for them’ ONCE... so losing sleepless nights and living in constant anxiety over them, I’ve been holding my breath and been walking on eggshells when they had no filter themselves. Yet I let them, passing it off as “just a joke” to myself because of how lonely and sad they kept whining to be and I wasn’t ever really one to turn my back on anyone in need, especially the ones I loved. But whenever I needed them they’d only judge me and talk shit to the point where I just didn’t trust them in my vulnerable state so I’d just play off my own problems like it’s nothing. But then all that suppression finally just got the better of me I guess as I started to turn to drugs with a guy whom I just barely met... When I realised this isn’t the path I wanted to go down, I isolated myself for about 2~3 months.. I became completely withdrawn, hardly saying much and just played games, neglecting to go to my lectures.. The only interaction I had was with my mother and my dog but other than that I became too scared of the world.. I needed time to reform myself and, as always, I was alone in doing it.. Occasionally I wanted to tell my parents but felt too ashamed and didn’t want to seem them hurt/make them feel like they’ve failed.. and I already knew I couldn’t turn to my “friends” cos I already knew they’d just call me stupid and say I don’t have a good enough reason to have done it. So I guess they’ll never know what happened, not that it matters since they never bothered to check up on me or ask thereafter. 
Anyways, the last time I heard from one of them was a while after I started to get better, feeling happier even. She came to me saying she was sad and lonely so I offered to keep her company... but for some reason she starts demeaning me and threatening to leave (again, they do that constantly where they kept pushing and pulling) for reasons still unclear so I just said that ultimately it’s her own free will... which some reason provoked her even more..? She also spoke for one the other one who apparently was mad at me too (idk what for considering I didn’t say or do anything ill-mannered to him beforehand) and didn’t think our ‘friendship’ was worth giving it a chance in saving for and hearing out whatever apparent offence I had done to him. It also indicated to me that they’ve been talking groundless shit about me behind my back and honestly I felt betrayed... But that’s also when it hit me — they didn’t care. I mean I’ve always known but I guess I was in denial, never fully realising it since I kept believing that it’d somehow make me the ‘bad guy’ otherwise.... I was drowning myself down deeper and deeper into a mess for people who wouldn’t have blinked an eye if I disappeared... and once I realised they’ll never be satisfied I just didn’t care anymore, I was done. And yknow what, I’m actually a lot happier too. 

Whilst I usually believe affairs like these should be kept between the people it concerns, I often turned to le citizens of thee internet whenever I was struggling with an internal conflict. Kinda like “researching” lol.
So I guess this is my shoutout to anyone out there looking for a sign who’s in a toxic friendship or any type of relationship, it’s okay to walk away.. I know it’s hard especially when you know the shit they’ve gone through and it plays guilty on your conscious or you truely love them.. but mental illness seriously isn’t an excuse to be abuse others. I have it, my whole family has some form of it too, so I understand and whilst it’s alright to sympathise with others who have it too, it’s not an excuse for them to bully you.. you deserve to take care of and love yourself too, to go and find your own happiness. 

Also keep mindful of your own actions too, I try to remind myself of everyday as well 😊

Btw please excuse the bad grammar and such it’s 1am here haha","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a story more for whoever else is in my position which I used to be in about toxic friendships.
Without tailoring on the details too much... but I had two ‘friends’ who I used to let walk over me because I felt sorry for how shitty their life was which lead them to develop mental problems such as depression and yeah.. yeah I know, I shouldn’t base any form of relationship on sympathy but I did also very much love and cared about them.. so for 8+ years I tried my best to always be there for them because hell knows what bs they’ll pin on you if you missed out on ‘being there for them’ ONCE... so losing sleepless nights and living in constant anxiety over them, I’ve been holding my breath and been walking on eggshells when they had no filter themselves. Yet I let them, passing it off as “just a joke” to myself because of how lonely and sad they kept whining to be and I wasn’t ever really one to turn my back on anyone in need, especially the ones I loved. But whenever I needed them they’d only judge me and talk shit to the point where I just didn’t trust them in my vulnerable state so I’d just play off my own problems like it’s nothing. But then all that suppression finally just got the better of me I guess as I started to turn to drugs with a guy whom I just barely met... When I realised this isn’t the path I wanted to go down, I isolated myself for about 2~3 months.. I became completely withdrawn, hardly saying much and just played games, neglecting to go to my lectures.. The only interaction I had was with my mother and my dog but other than that I became too scared of the world.. I needed time to reform myself and, as always, I was alone in doing it.. Occasionally I wanted to tell my parents but felt too ashamed and didn’t want to seem them hurt/make them feel like they’ve failed.. and I already knew I couldn’t turn to my “friends” cos I already knew they’d just call me stupid and say I don’t have a good enough reason to have done it. So I guess they’ll never know what happened, not that it matters since they never bothered to check up on me or ask thereafter. 
Anyways, the last time I heard from one of them was a while after I started to get better, feeling happier even. She came to me saying she was sad and lonely so I offered to keep her company... but for some reason she starts demeaning me and threatening to leave (again, they do that constantly where they kept pushing and pulling) for reasons still unclear so I just said that ultimately it’s her own free will... which some reason provoked her even more..?

There's two practices a week, if you miss three in a row or five in a month you're out. I've been in the orquestra for almost five years. And every time you miss a class you go back one seat, so only the people that don't miss any practices get to be on the front.
Spalla is like the main instrument in the orquestra. It's the first seat in the violins (at least at my orquestra's setup) and it's so fucking hard to get a chance to be. So I finnally did it. I'm fucking Spalla. I'm at the fucking top. So long I waited for this shit, I don't miss practices for like a year.

Maestro decided that I was going to be in the back rows, because why fucking not? There's too much noise, no one's paying attention, the orquestra sound horrible, I fucking die inside.

Although he admitted he loved me, there were several red flags. He would pressure for sex/nudes, criticize my hair/makeup/body, wouldn't let me know what's going on with his personal life, manipulative, and lied. Plus he would always ghost and only hit me up to come and mess around. I almost got in a crash driving from his place &amp; he didn't even care. The last straw was in August when he started saying harsh comments about me not giving him sex, how he would cheat, how no one would stay with me, etc. I blocked him on my social media. It wasn't until December when he called me to clear up things. My foolish self should have known to not answer because he asked to meet up that night (after not talking for 4 months). We planned to hang out twice that month, and he flaked. That's why I kept my distance.

Fast forward to May, he messaged me and said I barely check up on him &amp; didn't even apologize for bailing. My foolish self agreed to meet him at a motel room &amp; we just did foreplay. I haven't seen him since August and he was barely interested in catching up, pressured me for oral, called me annoying, and was on his phone. He didn't even say bye when we were done. He asked to go the movies on Wednesday, and I agreed. He never got back to me...nor message me since then. When I asked him what happened, he gaslighted. I was like okay.. not about to go through what I went through twice. So I blocked him on Snap. This is what he sent me yesterday via text.

I told him how he only hits me up to mess around when he has other girls, how I'm not brought to be down again or talked to anyhow, and how he's rude and abusive. He never replied after I told him this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I met this guy last April &amp;amp; we had a situationship (messed around but no sex bc I&amp;#39;m a virgin) until like August. He wanted a relationship, but I was still healing from my abusive ex, which I communicated to him. He is the second person I was ever intimate with. Although he admitted he loved me, there were several red flags. He would pressure for sex/nudes, criticize my hair/makeup/body, wouldn&amp;#39;t let me know what&amp;#39;s going on with his personal life, manipulative, and lied. Plus he would always ghost and only hit me up to come and mess around. I almost got in a crash driving from his place &amp;amp; he didn&amp;#39;t even care. The last straw was in August when he started saying harsh comments about me not giving him sex, how he would cheat, how no one would stay with me, etc. I blocked him on my social media.

Sorry if things get jumbled or ramble-y.

So I just need to vent about this because I hate what I am about do. 6-ish months ago I quit a toxic job. My boss was a complete psycho who created such an awful environment that it was abusive. I never knew which way was up, I cried when I got home every day and would actually wish that something awful (not self-inflicted) would happen to me so I wouldn't have to go to work. The boss was 90% of the problem, but not all of it, the company had its own issues.

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse was supportive at the time. I have worked in the same field for 15 years and I realized that I was miserable. I had stumbled into this field when I was 18 and it was never supposed to be my career. I decided to open a business doing something I really love. Now it is 6 months later and though the business is opened and has gotten a lot of love from customers, but the customers are far to few to keep me afloat. (Think crafty business like glass blowing)

&amp;#x200B;

That leads me to why I am here. I got a call today from a friend that my old company is hiring for a slightly better position than the one I had and I have a really good chance at it. The old boss is gone, so the primary issue is gone but the company still has issues and it is still the field of misery. And I am making no money right now. If I don't take this chance and my business doesn't take off then I could end up very broke, very soon. And worse, I will drag my spouse down with me. They make decent money but it is not enough to pay bills and build a savings account.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am going to apply for the job and I hate it. I hate that I can't find something that makes me happy AND makes me a decent wage. I hate that I am still going to be in an office stooge that I never wanted to be. I hate that I spent years putting my spouse through school with the promise of it being ""my time"" when they graduated with an advanced degree for him/her to take a job that pays way less than someone with the same degree would make because ""it is what I like most"" but I have to go back to a career I hate. I hate that I can't think of another option. I hate that everyone around me loves their job and I only seem to be qualified to do this one thing that I am good at but sucks out my soul (I have tried applying to jobs in other fields over the years and never seem to quite have what they are looking for). I hate that I have to go back to the place that made me miserable because it is the adult thing to do. Right now, I hate being an adult!

To begin with, I'm not a casual (I know, ""No true king"" etc.) I've rewatched the entire show multiple times and spend hours reading about lore on the ASOIAF/GOT wikis and watching videos on the subject on youtube. I've also watched every single ""Histories and lore"" at least twice. I haven't read the books, so you can be snooty about that if you want but I am in no way a casual fan of the show. I also think the the other ASOIAF/GOT subs are overmoderated shitholes and actively avoid them. Anyhoo, on the the main part of the post.

Like I said. I love season 8. I get the issues people have with it, and to some extent I agree, but there is plenty of stuff I do like, and what sort of annoying neckbeard type of shit-ass ass-person would I have to be to focus on the negatives and let it ruin the show that I love with all my heart. Were the seasons too short and would the story have been served better with more episodes? Maybe (ok, definitely), but I still enjoyed watching them, and not just for non-plot reasons.

""bUt jaMiES arC!""

Jamie going back to Cercei is fine and it doesn't ruin his arc IMO. His arc with Brienne was to help him break down the facade of dishonorable calluosness and cynicism he puts up to justify the horrid things he had done in the name of his love for Cercei. He was a knight no one though of as honorable, and Brienne is someone honorable no one thought of as a night, but she stood in front of a room full of people and declared him a man of honor, and he did the same declaring her a knight. They both help bring out what no one but them saw in each other and were both better people for it. This means that when Jamie heard that Dany was going to Kings Landing to, possibly, burn it down, he couldn't sit it out in the north. Stopping needless burning of cities is kind of his raison d'etre, and he certainly wasn't going to let a woman he had loved since he was a child die in that fire without trying to do something about it, because he, of all people, should know that we are more than the bad things we do. On some level I'm sure he also felt that he doesn't deserve to live were Cercei to die, as so many of the things he deserves to be punished for were done for her and their love for one another. The means things he says to Brienne was simply to make his leaving easier, same as Tyrion did to Shae to convince her to leave him after his marriage to Sansa. He always wanted to die in the arms of the woman he loved, he said as much in season 5, and he does love Cercei. And here is how I see Briennes ""role"" in his death: She was never his endgame, she was his path to redemption, his way of dying knowing that there was good in him, that he could earn the love and respect of someone truly honorable, even with all the bad in him and his past, and it made the choice to go in to a situation he knew would almost certainly kill him that much easier.

I'm kind impressed you can type anything about it at all concidering they had to amputate both your arms after all the fractures you suffered jerking yourself off too hard over the fact that you've read the books. They specifically left that part of Cerceis prophecy out of the show and now you're upset that there was no pay off... to something that was never there in the first place. They also never talked about gun-powder, are you upset that they didn't use machine guns to kill The Night King? I'm going to assume you were the same person who wouldn't stop talking about Lady Stoneheart while voilently cumming in your pants during earlier seasons.

""Night King lore 'n dat!""

Night king isn't in the books, so the show can do whatever they want with him. Also, what more fucking lore do you need, honestly? The children were at war with the first men, and were losing, so they came up with a way to use the humans superior numbers against them (this is mentioned this in one of the ""Histories and Lore"", can't remember exactly which one (so I guess I am a casual)) and made The White Walkers, starting with The Night King, who could weaponize the dead. Later, after peace was made between The First Men and The Children of the Forrest, both of them became a part of The Night Kings ""destroy humanity"" mission and at some point, the night king figured out how to turn young boys offered in sacrifice to him in to more White Walkers. Then the long night happend, humans+children won and Bran The Builder, well... he built. A wall specifically. The WW went back to The Lands of Always Winter and bided their time, which is easy to do when you're fucking immortal. Then they just waited for the right time to strike. Which wasn't right after their defeat and when The Wall was properly manned, and certainly not when Aegon was flying around with a shitload of dragons that could burn his army. It was probably best to wait untill no one belived they were real, except for like three people in a serverly undermanned and poorly trained Nights Watch and The Seven Kingdoms in complete dissaray. There, a complete history of The Nights King and The Army of The Dead. Could it have been expanded on more? Sure, but y'all seem to want a Ken Burns documentary or some shit.

""Azor Ahai, tho.""

Arya brough the Dawn, and The Lord of Light helped helped her. The god of death and darkness was defeated by the god of light and life by someone who was trained by people who worship death, and used the skills she learned there to fight for life (Check out ""The Take""s video on the subject, it's really good!).

# R'hllors plan, play by play:

**The Sandor Play**

Arya would never have been able to kill The Night King if Sandor hadn't saved her.

Sandor wouldn't have saved her if Beric hadn't snapped him out of his PTSD-episode.

Sandor wouldn't have been snapped out of it if he wasn't fond of Arya.

Sandor wouldn't have been fond of her if he hadn't brought her with him and gotten to know her.

Sandor wouldn't have brought her with him if he hadn't won the trial by combat against Beric.

Sandor wouldn't have been captured and put on trial if he hadn't left Kings Landing.

Sandor wouldn't have left Kings Landing if he wasn't afraid of fire, the physical manifestation of R'hllor.

**The Beric Play**

Beric wouldn't be able to give his life for Arya and get her to Mellisandre if he and Sandor hadn't saved her first.

Beric wouldn't be able to save Arya with Sandor if he hadn't snapped Sandor out of his PTSD-episode.

Beric wouldn't be able to snap Sandor out of it if he wasn't alive to do it.

Beric wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for R'hllor.

**The Mellisandre/Jon play**

Mellisandre wouldn't have motivated Arya to kill The Night King if Beric and Sandor hadn't gotten Arya to her.

Mellisandre wouldn't have been in Winterfell if Jon hadn't retaken it.

Jon wouldn't have retaken winterfell if R'hllor, through Mellisandre, hadn't revived him.

Mellisandre wouldn't have revived him if she wasn't at Castle Black.

Mellisandre wouldn't have been at Castle Black if she hadn't followed Stannis north.

Mellisandre wouldn't have followed Stannis north if she hadn't seen that he was the Prince that was promised in the flames, the physical manifestation of R'hllor.

Seems pretty prophecy-y to me. And the culmination of it was written by D&amp;D, two shit writers who can get nothing wrong and are literally the worst people, not writers, people, in the universe according to this sub.

""Dany went mad to suddenly!""

This is the one I most agree with y'all on, but I still enjoyed it. The seeds to this have been there since at least season two. She's wanted to burn citites at least twice before, when the masters retook the cities of Slavers Bay. First time, Jorah talked her out of it, he's dead now, second time Tyrion did it, he's a traitor in her eyes now. Any other person who could caution her and rein her in is either dead or someone she doesn't trust, and I like how they wrote the wedge forming there, even if more episodes would have been nicer. But this is what we have, and I liked it. Just because it's not the best version of it, doesn't mean it's bad. The scale doesn't jump from ""perfect"" to ""straight doo-doo"" and if we constantly compare things to the perfect version of everything we have in our head we'll always be disappointed. This applies to people who are waiting for the books to be the flawless-in-every-single-way version of everything they didn't like about the show. Nothing is as good as you're making these unpublished books out to be and you would do yourself a huge favor if you just chilled out a bit.

""if I wAS pLaNniNG tHe BAttlE oF WIntERfElL i WoUld hAvE etc...""

We got to see the good guys band together against the forces of evil and win the day, and the stakes were real because we **GENUINELY** didn't know they were going to win. When has that ever happened before? Pretty cool if you ask me! =)

And yes, they could probably have planned a better battle strategy, but it's an action driven episode and the rule of cool applies. Also, I think they did exactly what anyone with half a brain-cell would have done with the dragons. Realistically (I mean... for a world with dragons), if both sides of a conflict have dragons, most of what they would be doing would be making sure that the other sides dragons didn't do to much damage to your side. MAD applies and if you're off somewhere doing stuff with the dragon that isn't dragon control, that means the other dragon is doing terrible stuff to your side.

""Now you're just doing some post-hoc stuff to justify blah blah I probably annoy people at parties blah blah...""

# So?

Negativity is a choice and focusing on negatives when you don't have to will inform a lot of my opinion of you. The choice between creating justifications for liking something that has some flaws and creating justifications to hate and constantly shit on something that has many, many, positives is the easiest one I've made all year. Acknowledging something has problems while still enjoying the positives is normal. Claiming that there is nothing good about a thing that does have good things about it and whining about D&amp;D (The people who made Jon a witness to the events of Hardhome and wrote the destruction of The Bealor) being terrible writers is fucking annoying. Being able to talk at length about why you don't like something doesn't make you as interesting as someone who can do it for something they like (no, the irony is not lost on me) and it makes me want to go somewhere else and talk to other people. Attacking people who enjoy season 8 and saying they are casuals is vitriolic elitism, neckbeardy AF, belligerent and **VERY FUCKING ANNOYING.**

Would I change things if I could, sure, loads, and I would love to talk nicely about it, just as much as I want to talk nicely about all the stuff I like about the story this season. But I can't change it, and their not making any more episodes, so your ""True fans don't like season 8"" bullshit is less than useless as it stops people who haven't seen the show yet from getting in to it. I hope one day we can go down the prequelmemes route and share fun memes from season 7 &amp; 8, tounge-in-cheek claiming we love it untill it's no longer tongue-in-cheek. Nerd negativity is a plague and I hate what it does to a fandom, and I hope one day we come back from it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I&amp;#39;m not a casual (I know, &amp;quot;No true king&amp;quot; etc.) I&amp;#39;ve rewatched the entire show multiple times and spend hours reading about lore on the ASOIAF/GOT wikis and watching videos on the subject on youtube. I&amp;#39;ve also watched every single &amp;quot;Histories and lore&amp;quot; at least twice. I haven&amp;#39;t read the books, so you can be snooty about that if you want but I am in no way a casual fan of the show. I also think the the other ASOIAF/GOT subs are overmoderated shitholes and actively avoid them. Anyhoo, on the the main part of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said. I love season 8. I get the issues people have with it, and to some extent I agree, but there is plenty of stuff I do like, and what sort of annoying neckbeard type of shit-ass ass-person would I have to be to focus on the negatives and let it ruin the show that I love with all my heart. Were the seasons too short and would the story have been served better with more episodes? Maybe (ok, definitely), but I still enjoyed watching them, and not just for non-plot reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;bUt jaMiES arC!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie going back to Cercei is fine and it doesn&amp;#39;t ruin his arc IMO. His arc with Brienne was to help him break down the facade of dishonorable calluosness and cynicism he puts up to justify the horrid things he had done in the name of his love for Cercei. He was a knight no one though of as honorable, and Brienne is someone honorable no one thought of as a night, but she stood in front of a room full of people and declared him a man of honor, and he did the same declaring her a knight. They both help bring out what no one but them saw in each other and were both better people for it. This means that when Jamie heard that Dany was going to Kings Landing to, possibly, burn it down, he couldn&amp;#39;t sit it out in the north. Stopping needless burning of cities is kind of his raison d&amp;#39;etre, and he certainly wasn&amp;#39;t going to let a woman he had loved since he was a child die in that fire without trying to do something about it, because he, of all people, should know that we are more than the bad things we do. On some level I&amp;#39;m sure he also felt that he doesn&amp;#39;t deserve to live were Cercei to die, as so many of the things he deserves to be punished for were done for her and their love for one another. The means things he says to Brienne was simply to make his leaving easier, same as Tyrion did to Shae to convince her to leave him after his marriage to Sansa. He always wanted to die in the arms of the woman he loved, he said as much in season 5, and he does love Cercei. And here is how I see Briennes &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; in his death: She was never his endgame, she was his path to redemption, his way of dying knowing that there was good in him, that he could earn the love and respect of someone truly honorable, even with all the bad in him and his past, and it made the choice to go in to a situation he knew would almost certainly kill him that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Something something prophecy blah blah blah valonqar etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly mate, you need to shut the fuck up about Valonqar. I&amp;#39;m kind impressed you can type anything about it at all concidering they had to amputate both your arms after all the fractures you suffered jerking yourself off too hard over the fact that you&amp;#39;ve read the books. They specifically left that part of Cerceis prophecy out of the show and now you&amp;#39;re upset that there was no pay off... to something that was never there in the first place.

Later, after peace was made between The First Men and The Children of the Forrest, both of them became a part of The Night Kings &amp;quot;destroy humanity&amp;quot; mission and at some point, the night king figured out how to turn young boys offered in sacrifice to him in to more White Walkers. Then the long night happend, humans+children won and Bran The Builder, well... he built. A wall specifically. The WW went back to The Lands of Always Winter and bided their time, which is easy to do when you&amp;#39;re fucking immortal. Then they just waited for the right time to strike. Which wasn&amp;#39;t right after their defeat and when The Wall was properly manned, and certainly not when Aegon was flying around with a shitload of dragons that could burn his army.

My grandmas family offered to put her and my grandpa in a upscale nursing home but he somehow talked them out of it literally to be in control and take all that’s all there is to it. He wants to have what isn’t his.  He wants their every penny and always has. That’s his only motive. He’s always spent their money and had control over them. My grandma said it’s because her daughter died at 20 and they overcompensated by spoiling him. To me that’s no excuse to be an evil person. But whatever. I would blow up on him all the time when I was a teenager because of how he treated my grandparents. After my grandpa died, he now has power of attorney over my grandma from what I heard. 
I have 3 kids now, 2 of them are three year old boys. To get to what has me so mad today, he texted me that the boys HAVE to stay in one room when we go visit tomorrow (mind you, we hardly ever go visit because we live a bit away) because last time they broke his reading glasses. Now my kids may have went in another room but I watch them closely. He said it took him 3 HOURS to pick up after they left last time! BULLSHIT! I am always the type to pick up after my kids and this is once again just his way of being the controlling sick asshole he is. I had enough. I cussed him out. I’ve been holding in this for so long. And I said this is HER HOUSE. To which he said the house is now in his name and he can show me the papers. I assume this has something to do with the power of attorney thing, I have no idea. I am so sick by this. My grandma is 90 years old and this was supposed to be a nice visit. Now I’m scared to even go there because of the awkwardness and his controlling ways. I feel she’s scared of him and it’s such a shame. Her church friend even knows something’s shady about him cause my grandma mentioned to me last time she didn’t answer the door, her friend said she’d call the cops. I so wish I knew my family so I could out him. It wasn’t even really about the message but he’s been getting away with this for far too long and I’m so disgusted!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just needed somewhere to vent obviously.. but I’m so infuriated :( My dad has always been a horrible person, anyone that knows him could attest to that. My mom said he’s treated his family horribly forever. He made me touch him when I was little which I hate even talking about but that’s pretty much where my hatred stems from. He’s ALWAYS lived with my grandparents and been a bum, he’s had jobs but always fell back on them. Currently he’s in his 60s living with my grandma still. My grandpa has passed but he’s always been AWFUL to them. Treating them like dogs when they are the most amazing people ever.

On Mother's Day everything was fine, we had just finished eating dinner, watched some TV and she had fallen asleep when I heard gurgling. My Mom had become unresponsive so I called an ambulance. I had no idea she was fighting for her life, I just thought she had contracted a cold. After hours in the ER Waiting Room a doctor pulled me aside to say she had pneumonia, sepsis (a life-threatening infection, it's the leading cause of death in the US), had been sedated, a breathing tube inserted, put on life support and her kidneys had stopped working. His only consolation was that her heart was strong but by Monday morning it was showing signs of stress and by 2:00 p.m. she had had a heart attack. For 7 days she was kept sedated, tubed, on life support and underwent multiple procedures. Then on Monday at 6:24 a.m. they finally removed the tube, took her off life support and she was asking for me, a moment that made my heart flutter with joy, but she's far from out of the woods.

Still in the MICU in critical condition, I just gave consent to perform a search and possible operation on her stomach, they're looking for infectious tissue and ulcers; she's throwing up an abnormal amount. At this point her heart is weak, her kidneys are as damaged as a dialysis patient who's skipped treatment, she has a UTI and the sepsis has infected her lungs and bloodstream. Because we don't have a car it takes me 40 mins to walk there and 40 mins to walk home, something I don't mind doing. When I visit I can only stay for 3-4 hrs b/c we have two older medical service dogs and we live in an apartment, there's nowhere for them to go inside (although I've put down puppy pads just in case). When I'm not there I call in to check on her and with how worried I am, I do my best to keep my calls to a minimum knowing they have important work to do; and not just with my Mom. Everytime I call the nursing staff says I can call as often as I want, that I'm not bothering them, but I'm starting to think it's just something they've learned to say to make concerned family feel more at ease. To give an honest estimation I've gone through every call I've made since she's been admitted and unless I've had to give consent, none have lasted over 1 min 30 secs, which is quick; consent calls last an average of 3 mins. When I call I tell whoever answers which patient and room I'm calling for then wait a sec for her nurse to answer the phone; it's one nurse for every 2 patients on her floor and most patients are sedated or in a coma. After I get an update I have to quickly ask the nurse NOT to hang up on me - something I shouldn't have to do, right? Then I spew out my message as fast as I can.

Perfect example: I called before coming on here. I call, get transferred to her day nurse A. and when I ask how my Mom is doing he says, ""Oh actually I need your consent. Your Mom has been throwing up all day, the doctors think she might have an ulcer or infectious tissue in her stomach. They want to go in to check and perform a procedure to stop it, do we have your consent?"" (He used technical jargon but I can't remember the actual name he used) I give consent and he says, ""Okay I need you to speak with another nurse to give her consent too since this is being done over the phone."" I say, ""Sure but before you hand me to them could you please tell my Mom I love her with all of my heart and I want to see her badly but I can't. Her big pup is really sick and I don't want to leave her alone."" That's it, I don't think that's too much to convey but before I could finish my 10 sec message he interrupts me, ""Yeah, yeah, okay."" As I'm saying, ""Okay, thank you"" (although he doesn't deserve it), another voice is on the phone asking my name, relationship and what I'm giving consent for. Afraid A didn't listen to my message, I quickly ask this nurse not to hang up on me and relay the message again. She says, once again interrupting me, ""A. got it, he'll tell her"" and before I can say anything else it's silent, the line has been disconnected - she's hung up.

Everytime I call they spend the time to give me an update without any complications, which I appreciate, but the moment I try leaving a message, I get interrupted and hung up on. I've been there every day since she's been admitted, visiting usually 3x a day and when she was woken up on Monday, I was there from 6:55 a.m. - 1:30 a.m.; as you can imagine it was a lot of walking back and forth.

The ONLY reason I didn't go today was b/c this morning at 2:00 a.m., our big pup had an episode. She's never shown signs of anything wrong before this but when she went to stand up, she collapsed. At first I thought it was b/c she'd been sleeping, her legs had fallen asleep and trying to stand on the bed with a added pillow top was difficult; it's hard to balance on. Then she went to stand again and fell. This time her head went up to the left and awkwardly pulled to the right, her front legs shook inward and her paws curled. Her face went really taunt and her eyes looked weird. A few seconds passed and she attempted to stand again, walking to my pillows but keeping her rear end low. A few minutes after that she wanted off the bed so I picked her up and set her on the floor, sticking by her side. She walked awkwardly to her water bowl, drank, and then back into the room and threw up. Until 20 mins ago she's been sleeping. She woke up having to go potty and moved around like nothing happened this morning. For those saying, ""You should have taken her to a vet!"" I tried. I called the 3 emergency hospital's we have, all 3 said it would be $85 to get her seen, the vet would then make me a list of everything she'd need done and send me on my way to come up with the funds. Once I did, I'd have to pay another $85 to get her seen again and then they'd take care of her once I paid upfront. When the regular vets opened, I spent hours calling every one of them, they all gave the same story. We don't have the funds, my Mom and I don't even make $1,500 a month combined. I even applied for the two payment plan companies accepted by most vets and was denied by both: 1) not enough credit history. 2) not enough money to be approved. 

Needless to say I have a Mom fighting for her life in critical condition in the MICU by herself, worried she didn't get my message, and a pup I rescued 10.5 yrs ago seizing, vomiting and having hip problems, all at once and I'm dealing with it alone. What I want to know, if I can call as often as I want to check up on my Mom when I can't be there, why can't I leave a 10 sec message without being interrupted and hung up on? It's bullshit. The worse part, I have to wait until shift change to speak to someone else. Twice a day, between 6:30-8:00, they do a shift change. I've tried calling and asking the person who answers the phone to relay a message to my Mom but they immediately say, ""Let me get her nurse for you"" although I start my message with, ""You don't need to get my Mom's nurse, I want to leave my message for my Mom with you. Please just tell her I love her and when she wants me, to just have the nurse call."" (That's when they were waking her every 12 hrs to make sure there was no brain damage and putting her out again) It doesn't matter how I word it or if I get forceful, which I'm careful not to do so I don't get stopped from visiting, none of them listen and I haven't had a single conversation end with me ending the call. Am I wrong to be upset? Am I just emotional from everything? I'm pissed and the last thing I should be worried about is whether my Mom got my message. 

P.S. Yes I started a GoFundMe to raise money for her medical bills and to buy her the equipment and additional nursing she'll need when she finally gets home but the only sharing it's received is from my constant posting. So if any of you are willing to help spread her campaign, I'd be internally grateful! 

I don't think I can put a link here so if you go to GoFundMe.com and type in Shandee Lang in the search engine, the campaign is titled ""Praying for Italia"", the image is my Mom sedated on life support.

Why now? Why after all these years, you try to reach out to me now? 

We're nineteen years old, the last time we actually had a conversation was during the end of tenth grade. That was four years ago. Yes, we follow each other on social media, but isn't that just a common courtesy? I didn't want you back in my life. I was finally moving on from the hurt you caused me and now...

***Now you decided to come back and act like nothing happened.***  

We stopped being friends for many reasons, reasons that are still affecting my daily life even though I'm trying my fucking hardest to move past them! Let's look at a few, shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

1-  You **abandoned** me during my darkest moments. I reached the height of my depression during tenth grade. I was so tempted to jump from the fire escape to end my life every. single. day. You knew this. You knew this so fucking well and yet you had the audacity to get angry with me when I finally started seeing a counselor to help me. You didn't give much of a reason why, you were just angry with me for that reason.   
Not to mention at this time you started dating the guy who would sexually harass me during the first few months of being at the school. I **TOLD** you this. I felt dirty and ashamed for everything he put me through, but you fell in love with him anyways. You two began dating and I stepped back because he made you happy. **I wanted you happy**.   
I gave you space, I gave you time, and all I asked in return is that we spend one or two days of spring break to hang out *(which you agreed to)*.  So I waited. I made no plans because I was waiting for the day we could finally hang out. I called. I called. I called and you never fucking answered.   
   I wasted my spring break waiting for you to call me back and what did you say when you finally did?

""Oh, well, I was hanging out with (perv). Maybe next time""

   I was fucking heart broken. I was angry. I ended up contemplating suicide again because I felt like a nuisance for wasting your time. 

&amp;#x200B;

2-  **You let your mother hurt me.** I promised that I wouldn't let your mother hurt you. I stood up for you when she screamed at you. I stood up for you when she'd try to hurt you and would hold you while you cried during the aftermath. I was the one that screamed back when she'd belittle you. I nearly took a folding table over the head for you simply because you didn't wash the dishes. You never did or would have done the same for me.  
   We stayed after school to work on a photography project and the moment she walked into the classroom to see what was taking you so long she went right up to me, wrapped her arms around my head, and squeezed as tightly as she could all the while telling me- 

 ""Better get your work done.""

You didn't do anything. You simply logged off the computer, packed your backpack, and left. It took three hours for the  resulting headache to wear off. I still remember the pain and terror of that experience.   
When I told you I was suicidal you told her (*a reasonable decision since she's an adult*). What resulted after that was both of us had to comfort **her** because how dare I be suicidal when she has it so much worse. You didn't say anything. I went home hating myself more than I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

3- **You tried to force me into a relationship I didn't want**. Since you were just so happy with (perv), you decided it was in my best interest to set me up with a mutual friend. What resulted in this attempt was the final crack in our friendship. I told you I didn't want to start a relationship, I told the mutual friend, I told everyone that asked that I would **NOT** date this person.   
 Your mother called me out of school into the parking lot during lunch to **DEMAND** that I date (mutual friend) and that if I loved you or her, that I would do it. I was so shaken by this experience I called my mom, who at the time didn't know the extent of what your mother has done, and she was absolutely livid.   
  By the way, (mutual friend) also proved to be an absolute tool the more I refused to date him. He got my mom's number and began texting her none stop under the lie that it was the ""wrong number"", told many people we were dating while we weren't, and kissed my neck the moment I cut my hair short after he guilt tripped me into a hug. 

Your reaction the moment my mom got involved? You were dissapointed in me. How could I be so selfish as to not date this obvious tool of a man? Also, because I got my mom involved, I was no longer allowed to go over to your house or to call your mom ""my mom"" (*like I ever did in the first place*), and that I lost all yours and hers trust. 

I. Was. PISSED. I dealt with all your mental gymnastics, dealt with your narc mom, dealt with you dating the guy who would sexually harass me, I dealt with all the shit you pulled but the moment I refused to date someone who made me uncomfortable I was the obvious bad guy. 

  No, go fuck yourself with a cactus you prick. 

 So we fought. I told you I felt abandoned, you blamed me for putting stress on your perv boyfriend who had a skateboard accident (*he had a minor limp*). I brought up your lack of loyalty and that you never held up your promise during spring break, the things that hurt me most, and your reaction?

""So what? Get over it.""

Go fuck yourself with a cactus x 100,000,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Those were just a FEW of the examples that caused the downfall of our friendship and yet I still felt like it was my fault. For years I have felt like I was the one who pushed you away and that I had been the asshole, but the moment you slid into my DM's like nothing happened everything came flooding back. 

You were the biggest mistake of my life. 

 I trusted you. I loved you. I would have died for you, and in return? You destroyed me.

You made me feel unlovable.

You made me feel ugly.

You made me feel weak.

You made me feel like nothing.

So fuck you for that. Fuck you.

Even after four years I still can't stop the self loathing you've caused me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how fucking dare you? How DARE you try to contact me? How dare you act like nothing ever happened? How dare you?  

If you expect me to forgive you and that we can start over you can forget that from ever happening. 

If you expect me to give you my heart you're dumber than a sack of rocks. 

If you expect me to let you back into my life you're a dumb ass.

If you expect me to save you from your mother, deal with her yourself you absolute cuntweed. 

&amp;#x200B;

You caused me so much pain. I'd rather face hell and back than to let you do it again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the absolute fuck? Why now? Why after all these years, you try to reach out to me now? &lt;/p&gt;

It feels like humble bragging, but I really am tired of it. I have a job that pays well, and I want to help people with the extra money I don't need that they do. But whenever that happens, all conversation stops and it just turns into them thanking me.

Argh, I feel like such an asshole complaining about this, but I'd just like to buy my friends nice ingredients for a meal for a change, or help my friend make her next car payment, or spend money helping this young adult get out of an abusive household without being inundated with gratitude!

I know I don't have to do this! I'm not a great person, though! I'm just not going to keep a $40,000 raise to myself while my friends have to work 60-80 hours a week to make ends meet!

Or like, when I supported my boyfriend for a year while he struggled with addiction and couldn't get a job. I love him, and he struggled so much more than I did, but now he feels guilty, as if he tricked me into keeping him fed and off the streets. So now I have to keep a $5,000 informal loan over his head, money that I don't need and he doesn't have, so that he can sleep at night and feel like our relationship is balanced.

And lastly, this guy I'm giving shelter to. He's old enough to legally leave, and I'm going to be helping him move and partially supporting him while he gets his feet under him. I get that he's thankful, but I don't want to hear it every day.

&lt;p&gt;It feels like humble bragging, but I really am tired of it. I have a job that pays well, and I want to help people with the extra money I don&amp;#39;t need that they do. But whenever that happens, all conversation stops and it just turns into them thanking me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argh, I feel like such an asshole complaining about this, but I&amp;#39;d just like to buy my friends nice ingredients for a meal for a change, or help my friend make her next car payment, or spend money helping this young adult get out of an abusive household without being inundated with gratitude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I don&amp;#39;t have to do this! I&amp;#39;m not a great person, though! I&amp;#39;m just not going to keep a $40,000 raise to myself while my friends have to work 60-80 hours a week to make ends meet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or like, when I supported my boyfriend for a year while he struggled with addiction and couldn&amp;#39;t get a job. I love him, and he struggled so much more than I did, but now he feels guilty, as if he tricked me into keeping him fed and off the streets.

The latest thing that ticks me off, we needed a new vehicle, instead of looking at practicality she chose the one that she liked, $12,000. $3000 down payment and $500 a month. Within the first month the power steering fluid was leaking, the alternator broke, traction control broke, the roof leaked, it keeps wanting to kill when its idle and killed a few times. Were already poor enough and paid $4000 on this, she says ""Just fix it"" like we can afford to fix all this on top of all the money we already spent. She says she wants to keep it because ""We already spent $4000 on it"", better than fucking $12,000 and being stuck with this piece of shit. Only option is to bring it back and stop paying on it, we have another vehicle she can use but oh ""i dont like driving that one"" so because she doesnt like it we have to go broke, then this breaks and shes stuck with the other one any fucking way. We already owe the IRS $6000 and we need to get rid of it before they garnish our wages.(I say our, but i mean my Father's wages, my mom doesnt work for shit and sits on her ass all day or sleeps) But nooo, because she likes it we have to keep it, bullshit.

Anytime we try to talk about bills or our finacial situation she starts fake crying and screaming ""Shut up, kids shouldnt be talking about money with their parents"" Bitch i only see one child here and its the one crying anytime someone mentions money. I cant afford education, drivers ed, i cant even pay a $30 fee for a new birth certificate that SHE lost, and any money that Could go to any of that is going to her fucking piece of shit car.

My birthday was a week ago, you want to know what i bought? A fucking pack of gum i like, know what she said? ""We dont have the money for an extravagant gift"" I WONDER FUCKING WHY BITCH, I WONDER WHERE OUR MONEY IS, HMMM I CANT POSSIBLY THINK.

Please let me know if you think this behavior is considered normal and I am just being a paranoid rebellious teenager or if I do have reason to be concerned. Advice is not only welcome but requested.

 

• See me as a child and do not really treat me with respect 

• Assume that because they are my parents that I should always respect them no matter what 

• They are extremely emotional and over dramatic; if I criticize M at all she will get really upset and claim it is my fault she is so upset, which makes D really mad and start yelling at me and punishing me (in a not physical way, to be clear)

• They are really controlling, in most aspects of my life. I have no privacy - I have to repeatedly ask them for basic things such as knocking before entering my room. They regularly search my room, including all the drawers and in the closet, and call me sneaky when they find something they don't like.  

• They must know the passcode to all of my devices, and get upset if I change the password and do not tell them 

• Speaking of invading privacy, they go through my private messages (text, Discord, etc.) whenever they please, without warning. They see nothing wrong with this. 

• They want complete control over all my finances; get upset when I make a relatively major purchase without asking, and don't give me a debit because they believe I cannot be trusted with it. 

• They have stated multiple times that they do not trust me at all to make the right decisions, despite me almost being an adult. • My self-esteem regularly suffers on account of their actions. 

• They guilt trip me by saying that any conflict between us is my fault and that the rift growing between me and the family is because of my isolationist tendencies, failing to see that I am this way because of them

• D regularly uses shouting and anger to try to intimidate me into making me see his way. 

• Both can be very passive-aggressive when I do not agree with them about something.

 • If my opinion differs in any way about something significant, in their eyes, I am wrong.  
• I constantly feel pressured to succeed in an unhealthy way. Nothing I do is good enough, and if I fail I will be a disappointment. 

• If I am in the middle of a task, it universally does not matter what it is, if they decide that my time would be better spent helping them, then they demand that that is what I must do. 

• Get really critical of me wanting to quit a job that pays decently, but I really do not enjoy at all. 

• D is very two-sided; one moment he will be alright with me doing what I want, and the next he will suddenly be very demanding, aggressive, and critical of everything that I do

• D is a yes man to M. 

• When they get an opinion in their head about how I should live or behave, they try to jam me into that mold with no regard for what I want or feel 

• It often feels like they only want me to be successful because it will reflect well on them 

• Reflexively, their first punishment for any supposed wrongdoing is to take electronic devices away, even if the wrongdoing had nothing to do with said electronics  

• Set a bad example for spending habits: regularly go out to eat despite struggling to pay health insurance Bill's 

• Only let me go out so often because ""why do you need to see your friends, you saw them earlier this week"" 

* Their excuse for why I can't do or have something is often based on need (you don't need to do / have this) but they frequently disregard this statement when dealing with themselves or even my sibling
* I am a forgetful person, and frequently forget to do things they ask me to do. They do not believe me, thinking that I am lying about being forgetful to try and get away with not doing the work, and get irrationally angry when I do forget to do things.

I have basically become his excuse for what he does. He'll say ""well you do that so I'll do that too"" even though treatment for type 1 &amp; 2 are completely different and still just tells me. Someone **LIVING** with the illness what do you know.

This pisses me off on many levels: 1: he doesn't even know about his own illness (treatment for type 1 &amp; 2 are completely different) doesn't look like he even cares about his condition, eats loads upon loads of food and then wonders why none of the medication works for him. and then tells me I'M the one whos wrong. 2: I have been handling myself really well. my doctor has started calling me her Gold star patient because my stats are spot on. 3: when I tell him that he shouldn't eat certain things he criticizes me for eating in the middle of the night, even tho that for me when I do that I have low Blood sugar (hypoglycemia. it feels horrible) and can pass out and then have to go to the hospital if I don't eat something.

Someone &lt;strong&gt;LIVING&lt;/strong&gt; with the illness what do you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pisses me off on many levels: 1: he doesn&amp;#39;t even know about his own illness (treatment for type 1 &amp;amp; 2 are completely different) doesn&amp;#39;t look like he even cares about his condition, eats loads upon loads of food and then wonders why none of the medication works for him. and then tells me I&amp;#39;M the one whos wrong. 2: I have been handling myself really well. my doctor has started calling me her Gold star patient because my stats are spot on. 3: when I tell him that he shouldn&amp;#39;t eat certain things he criticizes me for eating in the middle of the night, even tho that for me when I do that I have low Blood sugar (hypoglycemia. it feels horrible) and can pass out and then have to go to the hospital if I don&amp;#39;t eat something.  It&amp;#39;s starting to really piss me off. it&amp;#39;s like his undermining all of my effort/progress as well as making it seem like this illness is easy to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, please excuse spelling/grama errors I&amp;#39;m also dyslexic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My Dad is telling me false things about my illness then proceeding to tell me I must be doing it wrong when I disagree and dismisses what the person living with the illness says while also ignoring his own condition which is similar but is treated medically in a completely different way.&lt;/p&gt;

I just cried to my friend for at least 3 hours after getting wasted, ended up talking about stuff in my past and pushed her away.

I don't know why but this is a consistent thing in my life, I always just end up getting close to a friend, almost obsessive with them, but the moment they do something by themselves or just generally miss a text or something I always get extremely anxious, irrational, paranoid, anything in the book really, and it's not like I'm aware.

I've been doing this for as far as I remember, chasing others so I can find someone I can care about for at least a small amount of time and fill some void in my chest, then immediately just throwing them away and hating myself for it.

I feel like it's just me being petty but I'm starting to get tired of it, the feeling of never being satisfied and I just... I don't know, I guess I'm just trying to get something that's been nagging at me for a long long time.

The longest friend I've had I met on my birthday last year, and even then I've had a few major falling outs with them, at this point I kind of feel like I have no future with people, just like... Wandering aimlessly in life trying to fill a void that doesn't exist.

Even today, I was at a family wedding, but I realized that all of my family members there either didn't want anything to do with me or I've pushed them all away in the past, idk... I'm getting tired of it, I feel like there's something wrong with me but at the same time... I just feel pointless even thinking that. 

Maybe I am a monster? But who knows, I certainly don't.

Its quiet a big story + its 2 am for me right now and i just gotta get rid of all this shit otherwise ill lay awake forever.

I hate myself, its not that i look into the mirror and say ""i hate you"" its that i reflect onto my life and think of how pathetic it all is

I wasnt much of an easy kid, though im not stupid, to be fair the IQ test did good and im scoring great marks in school (18 rn)

But my mother as a singlemom had financial issues (no doubt) but too proud to take money from the state and i never really aknowledged it, as she spend most of it on me and junk that i liked, 
I skipped most of 4th grade since i hated the teacher and still have some issues on spelling to this day.

As my Mom was mostly busy working we mostly ate processed stuff and sugary snacks so when i came into middleschool i turned into a ball

My ""best friend"" whom ive known since first grade started bullying me. I talk to him on a daily basis and sometimes i cant even meet his eyes...and hes my BEST friend, says much bout the quality of the rest huh?

Theres this other friend who ive known since 6-7th grade, he is a chronic liar and tried to push me and my best friend apart once we grew closer again,

Around that time my teacher came to me with an offer and i still to this day do not know what his intentions where and i guess i never will. 

He gave me the suggestion that ""since ive been working very hard in school recently i could go on a vacation program which would be one week of school and one week of the summer break"" like, what fucking public school would offer that kind of shit anyways?

So here i was, by now our financial situation had gotten better eventho my father was unemployed and always tried to make me happy on a tight budget (even worse then my mom, skipping meals and stuff for me...oh i wish i couldv yelled at him back then, but i mean i was only a child as if he wouldv listend to me)  and i basicly got the offer for a free vacation and missing out school. Which middleschooler wouldnt like that idea?

I agreed and a couple of weeks later my parents dropped me off at the place where it was suppost to begin. 


So we all got into some bus and started driving to a revreational facility in a small village between forests and hills (nice place to be fair, lots of green, lots of fields. Dead silent.) I dont mean this to sound rude but, i quickly noticed most kids had some quirks, either mental or physical. Overweight, underweight, mental issues etc. Odd, but i was still naiv. Then we started to be given rooms with the others and...oh boy, a diet plan. Yup, i would be weight regularily, my data beeing written down, the amount of food i was allowed to eat got restricted, while i could watch the anorexic boy nom down on a 5th slice of pizza (i dont mean to turn this into /fatlogic) otherwise, we were assigned tasks todo like toilet cleaning or mopping the floor, not quiet vaccation but not bad either. Our electronics were suspended except for 5 minutes each day. And then the fun began,

 i mustv been 13-14 at that point so right in puberty, there were only group showering areas with small curtains and the other boys found it funny to pull ones aside while showering, well there was that fat boy just trying to shower while regularly laugthed at...not the worst yet, im not a pussy. I hope. 

So that one time we were in our dorm room,  (me and two other guys around my age) and the group was fairly mixed of age 9-17ish.

Well, inside came a 17 year old guy who apperiantly got a bit...frustrated after beeing only with boys for a week or so, sharing a room. So he locked the door behind him, told us to shut up and pulled his pants down, i dont feel like discribing what he had me do, and it makes me cry inside that some still laugth about male abuse victims.


Anyways, there i was, mentally broken, kilometers away from home with a group of random boys in a almost authoritarian establishment, i talked to another boy about what happend and we went to the administration. After stuttering and crying to her what had happend, the woman in charge made sure that my clothes would be washed and disinfected and the guy would ""get a serious talk"" that was it.

The following week i counted the hours until we would get our phones back. I could have killed for those 5 minutes, talking to my mother, my father, grandparents...anyone, knowing that they were there, telling them that i loved them, just knowing that life went on outside. The worst part was thay it was always around 3-4ish pm when everyone was working or doing stuff, this hellish time, waiting for them to pick up....only to run out of time before they do so....i wanted to scream, 5 minutes.... 5 minutes was what i got ! 5 MINUTES TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM THAT HELL AND INTO ANOTHER PLACE AND FOR SOME GODFORSAKEN REASON THEY COULDNT PICK UP.

I left the place after the two weeks and i almost cried when i saw the familiar bridges and trains of the city (but i didnt cause thats unmanly and weak) and when i got back, i hugged my mother and my father, i loved them, i never wanted to be eithout them again and my father had a present for me ""bla, responsibility of beeing alone, bla"" he gave me a swiss army knife, im inspecting it right now, thinking about all that happend..... imagine he wouldv given it to me one week before that, things wouldv probably changed a lot. I never told any of them, they were quiet excited about the fact that i had a free holiday from school and i didnt want to ruin their bubble, besides they wouldv probably dragged me to a psychologist...oh the bills. To my parents knowledge, i had a great summer



Anyways, live slowly returned to normal and i tried to erase those memorys the besy i could until they popped back up when i was 16.


But back to younger me, i must have been 15 or so and two mayor things happend, for one i had a girlfriend, it was only long distance tho and it wouldnt be for another year before we'd actually meet up (pathetic isnt it? But it ment so much to me after beeing so emotionaly down) and i wanted to get in shape (noone wants a chubby bf afterall) so i got into contact with one of the only guys who hadnt broken my trust yet, honestly he hasnt to this day we just...never really grew much together regarding interests and stuff, ill hit him up tomorrow. I asked him if he could give me tips since hes a healthnut and soon we planned everything to start going jogging in the local park, and my best friend and that chronic liar friend decided to join. 

I gave my best, tried to keep up, tried to pull through but the reality was that i have been out of shape for years and i naturaly started slowing down and shit and so mr chronic liar anf best friend decided it would be best to motivate me by running behind me with a large stick they grabbed somewhere from the park and if i slowed doen to much they smacked it against my legs (was a bit of a bending wood so while it wasnt as firm as a cane or something, it added a blow from the motion) needless to say i stopped going very soon, going so far as taking the battery out of my phone, pretending i wasnt there when they came around to check where i was. 

Eventually it died down eventho they occasionally made jokes about me beeing a whimp.



When i turned 16ish i could get into the local gym with a permission slip from my parents and i proceeded to get rid of around 40 kilos (im at 63kg at a height of roughtly 175cm rn) in the span of a year, tho my skin is still flabbing around since i havent focused on muscle gain yet, and theres scars all over my body, its not very encouraging to be honest. Anyways, most of these negative events have been over for almost two years now and i almost got the feel like my life was all inorder but recently i noticed that the chronic liar is still plotting and talking behind my back, my best friend doesnt want me on his party since he got some new friends who dont like me and i just feel like a 5th tire again.


Now, going back to my girlfriend from that time (i must seem to be jumping back and forth, i apologize for that its just...how things fly into my mind rn) 

She was brilliant and once we did meet gave me a super unfamiliar but pleasant vibe. There was this one thing, that put me off and it was the simple fact that she loved me for who i was. Sure there was the cuddeling, the kissing and the sex...but she appreciated me personaly, while others previously tried to change my personality or my body....she accepted me as the mess i was and id love that kind of feeling again from someone who isnt family, but i cant figure out how to be confident, how to be me....everything that was me has always been in a constant change since someone who i thought was my friend tried to change it, talked bad about it or bullied me for it. I feel like im a burden to anyonr i open up so i generaly dont. I think it helped me quiet a bit to open up here and i hope you had a better time reading through my life then i had living it so far. 

Sometimes i am suprised that i dont percieve myself as ""depressed"" or ""suicidal"" i dont know why i go on, maybe im really just a pussy or a crybaby. I dont know.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there, i hope im right here in venting, if not please be so kind and tell me if theres a more appropriate subreddit and ill delete this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there i was, mentally broken, kilometers away from home with a group of random boys in a almost authoritarian establishment, i talked to another boy about what happend and we went to the administration. After stuttering and crying to her what had happend, the woman in charge made sure that my clothes would be washed and disinfected and the guy would &amp;quot;get a serious talk&amp;quot; that was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following week i counted the hours until we would get our phones back. I could have killed for those 5 minutes, talking to my mother, my father, grandparents...anyone, knowing that they were there, telling them that i loved them, just knowing that life went on outside. The worst part was thay it was always around 3-4ish pm when everyone was working or doing stuff, this hellish time, waiting for them to pick up....only to run out of time before they do so....i wanted to scream, 5 minutes.... 5 minutes was what i got ! 5 MINUTES TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM THAT HELL AND INTO ANOTHER PLACE AND FOR SOME GODFORSAKEN REASON THEY COULDNT PICK UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the place after the two weeks and i almost cried when i saw the familiar bridges and trains of the city (but i didnt cause thats unmanly and weak) and when i got back, i hugged my mother and my father, i loved them, i never wanted to be eithout them again and my father had a present for me &amp;quot;bla, responsibility of beeing alone, bla&amp;quot; he gave me a swiss army knife, im inspecting it right now, thinking about all that happend..... imagine he wouldv given it to me one week before that, things wouldv probably changed a lot. I never told any of them, they were quiet excited about the fact that i had a free holiday from school and i didnt want to ruin their bubble, besides they wouldv probably dragged me to a psychologist...oh the bills. To my parents knowledge, i had a great summer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, live slowly returned to normal and i tried to erase those memorys the besy i could until they popped back up when i was 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to younger me, i must have been 15 or so and two mayor things happend, for one i had a girlfriend, it was only long distance tho and it wouldnt be for another year before we&amp;#39;d actually meet up (pathetic isnt it? But it ment so much to me after beeing so emotionaly down) and i wanted to get in shape (noone wants a chubby bf afterall) so i got into contact with one of the only guys who hadnt broken my trust yet, honestly he hasnt to this day we just...never really grew much together regarding interests and stuff, ill hit him up tomorrow. I asked him if he could give me tips since hes a healthnut and soon we planned everything to start going jogging in the local park, and my best friend and that chronic liar friend decided to join. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave my best, tried to keep up, tried to pull through but the reality was that i have been out of shape for years and i naturaly started slowing down and shit and so mr chronic liar anf best friend decided it would be best to motivate me by running behind me with a large stick they grabbed somewhere from the park and if i slowed doen to much they smacked it against my legs (was a bit of a bending wood so while it wasnt as firm as a cane or something, it added a blow from the motion) needless to say i stopped going very soon, going so far as taking the battery out of my phone, pretending i wasnt there when they came around to check where i was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually it died down eventho they occasionally made jokes about me beeing a whimp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When i turned 16ish i could get into the local gym with a permission slip from my parents and i proceeded to get rid of around 40 kilos (im at 63kg at a height of roughtly 175cm rn) in the span of a year, tho my skin is still flabbing around since i havent focused on muscle gain yet, and theres scars all over my body, its not very encouraging to be honest. Anyways, most of these negative events have been over for almost two years now and i almost got the feel like my life was all inorder but recently i noticed that the chronic liar is still plotting and talking behind my back, my best friend doesnt want me on his party since he got some new friends who dont like me and i just feel like a 5th tire again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, going back to my girlfriend from that time (i must seem to be jumping back and forth, i apologize for that its just...how things fly into my mind rn) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was brilliant and once we did meet gave me a super unfamiliar but pleasant vibe. There was this one thing, that put me off and it was the simple fact that she loved me for who i was. Sure there was the cuddeling, the kissing and the sex...but she appreciated me personaly, while others previously tried to change my personality or my body....she accepted me as the mess i was and id love that kind of feeling again from someone who isnt family, but i cant figure out how to be confident, how to be me....everything that was me has always been in a constant change since someone who i thought was my friend tried to change it, talked bad about it or bullied me for it. I feel like im a burden to anyonr i open up so i generaly dont. I think it helped me quiet a bit to open up here and i hope you had a better time reading through my life then i had living it so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes i am suprised that i dont percieve myself as &amp;quot;depressed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;suicidal&amp;quot; i dont know why i go on, maybe im really just a pussy or a crybaby. I dont know.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 23 now and only had sex twice in my life up until a bit after i was 21. I used to be bullyed in highschool and my confidence was super low. like Imagine masturbating twice a week and not being able to look a girl in the eye nevermind talk to them. in the meantime i however went to the gym since i've been 17. I'm no fitness but i got pretty big and this helped my confidence in the end. after i was 21 i kind of decided to change and occasionaly asked a girl out. I always was kinda cute looking but never believed that because of my low confidence. dates usually went bad or i was to nervous to notice they went allright. when i was 22 i went to thailand somehow got laid a couple of times and after that i realised i had no reason to be insecure about myself because one kinda supermodel was into at the airport. That was the first time in my life where i girl i found really hot actually had interest in me, i couldn't believe it and there i decided i was gonna be good at dating or ""getting girls"". fast forward 4 months and i got laid a couple of times (like 6) which for me was unthinkable a half year before that. since i thought i was never gonna find a wife or gf. I cried a couple of times of relief because i was just that happy that i was actually able to get some girls. I was still a bit of a nice guy in that i expected a girl to sleep with me aslong as i would behave in an ""Alpha"" way. so actually the opposite of most nice guys who are to carefull and super friendly. I was really agressive. Like force a kiss on a first date if the girl is uncomfortable agressive and always touch in a sexual manner quite early after meeting. Looking back on that time which is only 1.5 years ago it was a out of compensation behaviour for sure. in the end i ended up being a bit calmer and not caring so much about results as long as i put in the effort. i knew i wanted a gf. i ended up dating 2 girls at once (big mistake since one was a virgin and i did screw her up a bit for a while, which i really regretted for a long time) and chose the other girl.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

in that period i kind of grew out of expecting girls to have sex with me and if she didnt want it i would be dissapointed but at the same time not blame her, but instead thought i could have been more sedusive or something like that. after a while i just wanted to get out there and still care about getting laid but atleast being direct about it and never settling for being friends. i would usally take a girl out for a drink try tro kiss them and that same night try to have sex with them. in hindsight i was needy in a different way than usualy but atleast i wasnt a pussy i thought. so backforward to now. i had a relationship with that girl for a year in which i learned a lot: how to love, how to love myself, how to grow, how to have sex etc etc. it didnt work anymore and i fell for another girl after a month. I had a near metoo moment in which me and that girl communicated badly and she didnt feel safe with me anymore. i was crushed and even tough that relationship only lasted 2 months it shook me harder than the breakup of the long relationship. since january i started dating again and since then have had sex with a couple of girls again. I somehow had a lot of things to prove to myself again after those 2 relationships. wether i can get girls or not etc etc. and i know 5 is not a lot in 4 months but i was still happy with it i guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also super happy that i became less agressive because looking back at it. i have had my most succes when i am being chill but still show my interest without expecting anything out of it and especially without pushing hard. i have had a girl sleep next to me without anything happening who later ended up being my fwb. i was clear i wanted to fuck her from the start but she wanted to see wether i was a psycho or not i guess. I was not agressive and ended up have some nice memories with her. after that some other girls came, some from tinder, some from the uni( never by going out), i can get a bit agressive when I'm drunk so i usually am less succesfull that way.  I also learned to embrace that i am a cute guy by nature, and looks.(look at my profile if you want) i learned to be okay with rejection (since my last short relationship i started dating in january as said) and have been rejected quite some times in public, other times by dating apps and also sometimes after meeting for a date. that is all okay. i have been rejected many times and i do really like girls a lot im still very direct and i've even built a bit of a reputation for myself here that i'm a guy who is decent with ladies. not everybody is interested but some girls are and some of them i like. I am somebody who falls in love easily and am a natural sweetheart but still assertive and keep my boundaries stand my ground etc. i am also more direct than smooth but im trying to be even more smooth. So fast forward even more and we get to now. I have grown a lot about dating and my own confidence and happiness with that aswell. i know am confident i am able to get laid with 12 different hot girls every year. which is more than i could ever dream of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I go. Another voice in the untold thousands up on thousands of people struggling in the world today, and I have the gall to want to post about my problems to the world on the vague chance it might make me feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, here goes nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it all starts with a need. That need that boils up in your chest, that vacancy that needs to be filled. I'm talking about the feeling of wanting to be happy. Not just 'I found a 5$ bill on the sidewalk' happy, but truly, totally, utterly fulfilled happy. The kind of utterly happy you feel at the end of a movie, or the credits of a good ending on a dating sim. You know.

&amp;#x200B;

The kind of ending the dark voices in your head tell you that you will never get because you are an insignificant waste of life.

&amp;#x200B;

At least... that's what those voices say. The world keeps telling you how it is just going to 'get better', and that just 'faking it till you make it' will work out. And sure, for some folks that works out just fine. For some people, after some time of just trying \*reeeaally\* hard to fake it, you do end up changing the way your brain works. You find that partner or that job or that hobby that makes you utterly happy.

&amp;#x200B;

For others, that isn't so easy. I know this from personal experience as I am that person who has been told those things over and over again. Yes, I've tried the pills, yes I've read those books and pushed as hard as I can to say things in the mirror even though it feels like I would rather have shards of glass rip through my chest than to bear with the pain I deal with just by trying to fight the darkness in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

There it goes again, that dark voice. You can recognize it by its tone. Maybe its someone you loved, who planted those seeds in your head. Maybe a parent or a bully or... whatever. Truth is its there. It always is, like some dark gargoyle planted on your shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and therapy is great... for like the first few days after. I've been to enough of it to know, seen enough doctors who have put me on this pill or told me to try that technique of thinking. They say I'm 'high functioning' because I can fake being normal really really well. Well enough to hold down a job? For a few months at a time. Painfully and slowly imploding.

""Alphabet Soup"" they called me, due to the vast number of mental conditions I have. So many so that the intake lady at the last place I went to looked at me as though I would turn into some monster and eat her.

&amp;#x200B;

On that list is suicidal. No, I don't mean the ""I'm going to go kill myself after making this post"" suicidal, and yes I do have the suicide prevention hotline number and its on speed dial on my phone. Three different ones for different things.

&amp;#x200B;

No, I'm talking about the suicidal which is the mental condition whereby your brain constantly wants to find a way to end its existence. There isn't a day that goes by, even the really happy ones, where suicide doesn't, albeit briefly, pop into my head. Sadly every chemical they have given me to try and balance this out has ended up in me being horrendously sick. Its as if my body itself knows I shouldn't be here and actively tries to just end things because somewhere it knows it would be better in whatever future is out there past death.

&amp;#x200B;

But... the other adage that comes up is ""What about all the people who love you? Don't you love them?""

Why yes, voices of those who care about me, I do. I love them so very much. And the way I show it is by staying here with every ounce and fiber of my being. I cling to this life and push and force my way through each day. I know far too many people that do that too. Yet, you have to realize that that adage is a guilt trip.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone was touching a burning pan and yowling about it, the answer to getting the pain to stop is to pull your hand away. Yet, when existence is pain, why is it that death is so terrible of an option? You would be stopping the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Worse still are those who chime in ""Its all in your head! You can beat it!""

&amp;#x200B;

That sounds great and all, but yes. It is in my head. Its not something I can just remove, or heal like a wound with salve and a bandage. Depression is etched into the very synapses and wiring of your head, like runes on an ancient stone.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that on top of it I hear the voices of abusers past, those who's patience eventually dried up. I don't blame them. Hell, would I stay soft and sweet and kind if the person I loved kept spiraling again and again into darkness? Perhaps I wouldn't. But... that cycle just cements the voice of ""They couldn't handle you. You are too much. No one will ever be able to handle you. You need to be locked away where no one can get hurt by you again.""

At least, that's what the voices say.

&amp;#x200B;

To wrap around to the beginning... the feeling of being ""Happy""... what is that feeling? Is it made of something? Is it something that can be pinned down? Scientifically speaking it's serotonin that courses through your brain. Well if that is the case, why is it that my brain doesn't have enough? Why is it that when I stop and think, I can't help but contemplate what a miserable excuse for a human I am and I shouldn't be here. That no one should ever love me because I know myself well enough to know that this thing? This thing right here? Where I imagine how nice it must be to die? That this will happen again. And again, and again. And... would I want to put someone through that? Because I'm... what... witty? Because a few people think I'm attractive? Or smart?

&amp;#x200B;

When the pain in your mind spills out into the real world, what are you? Toxic. You waste out there, and cause pain to all others around you. You are infectious, diseased, and only good to rot those who love and care for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Because at the end of the day, no matter how much of a face you put on, you HATE yourself. You utterly LOATHE the creature that stares back at you from the mirror. If you could quantify it, your DETESTATION for yourself would rival that of every grain of sand on all the worlds combined.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet...

&amp;#x200B;

You still get that feeling. That empty feeling, that hole, that... deep silent prayer that one day you will find someone or something that makes you happy. You imagine what it must feel like... to be able to let down your guard. Sure people love you... but do they understand you? What you are going through?

No.

But one day someone might. And for that... you hang on just a little longer... cry a little more... and pray one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Those voices will go silent.

&amp;#x200B;

And you will be happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Depression. Also I realized I didn&amp;#39;t add kink to this until after I clicked submit, so I apologize for disappointing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I go. Another voice in the untold thousands up on thousands of people struggling in the world today, and I have the gall to want to post about my problems to the world on the vague chance it might make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here goes nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it all starts with a need. That need that boils up in your chest, that vacancy that needs to be filled. I&amp;#39;m talking about the feeling of wanting to be happy. Not just &amp;#39;I found a 5$ bill on the sidewalk&amp;#39; happy, but truly, totally, utterly fulfilled happy. The kind of utterly happy you feel at the end of a movie, or the credits of a good ending on a dating sim. You know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of ending the dark voices in your head tell you that you will never get because you are an insignificant waste of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least... that&amp;#39;s what those voices say. The world keeps telling you how it is just going to &amp;#39;get better&amp;#39;, and that just &amp;#39;faking it till you make it&amp;#39; will work out. And sure, for some folks that works out just fine. For some people, after some time of just trying *reeeaally* hard to fake it, you do end up changing the way your brain works. You find that partner or that job or that hobby that makes you utterly happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For others, that isn&amp;#39;t so easy. I know this from personal experience as I am that person who has been told those things over and over again. Yes, I&amp;#39;ve tried the pills, yes I&amp;#39;ve read those books and pushed as hard as I can to say things in the mirror even though it feels like I would rather have shards of glass rip through my chest than to bear with the pain I deal with just by trying to fight the darkness in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been calling around my area for consultation and everyone wants fucking money. Lots of money. I&amp;#39;m a stay at home dad with 15 bucks to my name. I dont work because I&amp;#39;m disabled. I&amp;#39;m not getting disability because I&amp;#39;m a man and not only am I a man. I am a very husky and strong man. So therefore due to sexual discrimination laws. I automatically get denied any kind of support and cant keep a job. So again comes the story of a dad losing his kids and being homeless forever because theres no fucking way I can afford a lawyer to fight for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Shitty mother day leads to divorce Monday, but I cant afford an attorney&lt;/p&gt;

Maintenance, custodians, front desk employees— we are friendly with each other and they’ve all made our stay in this community enjoyable and comfortable. Until yesterday.

I had a grocery delivery service dropping off my order but received a notification that they were going to be early. I was still out and since I knew I would have a couple boxes of frozen stuff, I texted my neighbor if she could grab them and place them in her freezer. She didn’t answer my text so I asked another neighbor to do it. This neighbor replies and said there were no groceries at my door. I figured it was either a glitch in my delivery app or the first neighbor grabbed the groceries without replying. She is in her 60’s so her texting etiquette is a little different.

When I got to my building, not yet in my unit, I saw a text from the first neighbor saying that she wasn’t home, but her husband too care of the groceries. Before I went to my unit, I knocked on his door to retrieve the groceries. No one answered. I figured he was out and I’d just pick them up later. No big deal.

Then I got to my unit and noticed that the groceries were IN MY APARTMENT PUT AWAY. I nearly had a heart attack thinking of him in my place, looking through my shit, seeing my messes. Then I wondered how he got in.... he does not have a key and I have never invited him inside my place. The only answer was that one of the employees let him in. 

I immediately went downstairs to see what happened. The girl at the front desk, who is very nice but a bit of an airhead, told me that the neighbor came down to her and interrupted her tour (for prospective tenants) and rudely demanded that she give him a set of keys to my apartment so he could put my groceries away. She said she was caught off guard and felt under pressure from him so she “just gave them to him”. I was visibly upset because this type of thing really struck a nerve for me. She apologized and said it would never happen again. 

She also said that if I ever am in that situation again with the groceries that she would take care of it, which I really feel is not the issue at all. The issue is she gave keys to my apartment to another person who is not in my guest list (in my apartment file). 

Another issue is this weirdo thinks it’s ok to demand keys to another persons apartment without their permissions Luckily I have security cameras in my place so I watched his every move. He really did just put the groceries away but there was a part where he washed his hands in my kitchen sink and shook them dry for about 30 seconds (still at the sink) while he spanned the apartment. 

This guy and his wife are retired, seemingly lonely empty nesters who are nice people but I always get the vibe that they want more out of our relationship (we are not friends, just neighbors). They’re also quite nosy. 

I don’t want to report the girl who did this because I KNOW she would get fired and also I’m afraid it would sour the whole environment that I used to love so much. I also don’t want to confront the guy because I have to live next to him and don’t want to make things awkward. What these people did is not ok but I don’t know how to deal with it!!

The first week of school this year I walked into one of my classes looking for some friends and seeing who I would begrudgingly share the next 9 months of my life with, when suddenly in walked a boy who instantly caught my eye. I'm not going to go super into detail so let's just say for the next SEVERAL months I would become HEAVILY infatuated with this boy.

I’m a full time student at college here in Scotland, now I’m a mature student (over 25), and there is another girl in my class who is the same.

Today when I came out of college I noticed her (the other mature, if can say that, student) running away from my car. Now my mate who’s in the same class as us, thought I had left my cup from BK at lunch on the roof, but I know I hadn’t, when we got to the car I was shocked when the other lass and another lass from our class (she’s like about 18 or something), laughed and made a snidey comment about THEIR rubbish being on my car... we knew it was theirs because they go to McDonald’s and we go to BK.

Now I don’t know, but to me this is something a high school kid would do, I certainly wouldn’t do it, especially when I knew the person has a mental illness and has been under a lot of stress lately due to personal circumstances.

I texted her about this and mentioned how I thought it was wrong and immature, this person wants to be a mental health nurse by the way, and she ended up bringing our mate into it all when I specifically mentioned it was only me who was pissed, I mentioned that her actions could border into bullying, now as someone who’s been bullied most of her days, I have some knowledge of what’s what etc... but she retaliated by saying that I was a bully because she gave me and my mate lifts (before I passed my test), which we always asked if it was ok etc. and other things were brought up but won’t get into that. I even mentioned that I knew she would be pissed if someone did it to her car, my mate wants to do it but I said let’s not stoop to their levels.

I have mentioned that all that needs to be done is her realising the stupidity of her actions and apologise and we can move on, but she seems to want to drag it out, I feel that the 18 year old is manipulating her on so many ways.

I&amp;#39;m told to not be so hard on my mother but I&amp;#39;m 22 and still being treated as if I&amp;#39;m a teenager! I wish my brother would help me out. I just want to give up everyday. None of this is healthy, I know but I don&amp;#39;t know whatelse I can do. I feel like I was born to just fail despite everyone saying I had potential and could succeed and be a leader. Maybe those people were just getting my hopes up. This is how I feel constantly but I don&amp;#39;t want to tell anyone because, I don&amp;#39;t want to disappoint them as well. I already disappoint my mother no matter what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been dealing with mental health issues for a couple of years now and at first, it was tolerable (and unnoticeable by friends and family) but it’s been a slippery slope and everything has just all gone wrong all at the same time. I don’t want to be one of those people that just assigns myself a mental illness, but idk what is wrong with me at this point. I don’t know what is causing me to do this stuff or why I am becoming increasingly self destructive and decreasingly self controlled.

I went abroad, made a lot of friends, and caused them to resent me by the end of the trip. My boyfriend and best friend who went with me were having trouble dealing with the burdens I put on them. I never meant to let it affect others.

I missed out on opportunities of a lifetime while abroad by skipping free trips to historical sites and Mediterranean islands that the school organized. I just stopped feeling the motivation to get out of bed even though I spent those entire days hating myself and immediately regretting my decision, yet I still stayed in bed for the rest of the day, and then did the same thing when the next trip came up.

I took out my anger on another best friend countless times because of random bouts of insecurity or paranoia or I don’t even know. She’s been very understanding through this but it’s not going to be easy to mend the relationship. I worry that she’s too fed up with my bullshit that she won’t even think it’s worth the effort to mend.

I spent what feels like almost two entire semesters in bed. A lot of it was spent in my boyfriend’s bed because I hated being alone and, though he had a single bedroom, his roommates began to dislike me as they saw me as a moocher/lazy/intruding/etc. I could feel that they had thoughts like this towards me very early but I struggled to change my behavior. I have never been that girl that needs her boyfriend 24/7 and overstays her welcome and I hate that I did the exact opposite.

I have never been in a long term relationship before my current boyfriend and I’m not the type of person to want to rely someone, but I’ve become very emotionally dependent on him and I’ve lashed out at him for no reason  thousands of times, let him carry my burden, and allowed him to basically put me first. I think whatever I have mentally wrong with me had hit a climax and plateaued there for a while during the middle of our relationship. We began having issues this semester and while I’ve been trying to improve my demeanor (especially around him since he’s taken so much of my bullshit), he had less and less desire to put up with me and mend our issues because of how long it had gone on, especially when I had days that I regressed. He was my absolute closest friend years before we dated, so he knew the real me and thought that being in the relationship changed me for the worse when I know it was just my mental health going downhill. He broke it off with me, but it was obvious that he was done with me long before he did it.

I have done so terribly this semester due to my own shortcomings and throwing in the towel multiple times that I will most likely be dismissed from college. I have spent three years building a life here with the closest friends I’ve ever had. I barely saw most of them this semester, aside from parties, and now I’ll have a reduced opportunity of seeing them. They are my lifeline and I didn’t put in the effort like I used to, and putting in the effort used to come easy for the people I love. I slept a lot instead.

The worst part about all of this was I was conscious of what I was doing, but it all seemed unintentional in a way, like I only knew I was fucking up after committing the action, and then would do the same thing the next day. And it just piled up. And yet I am still devastated by my breakup, by my friends’ distance, by my grades...

Why didn’t I give my boyfriend a break when he needed it?  He had dealt with the worst of me for over a year, why did I never lift his burden when I could feel it weighing him down? Why didn’t I spend more time with my friends doing the things we love? Why didn’t I make an effort to see them more when I know that’s all I wanted? Why was I terrible and anxious and insecure to my best friends when all they ever want to do is help? Why didn’t I just go to class and do the assignments, especially when the dean gave me a bailout mid semester? 

The days just turned into weeks into months and now it’s too late. I don’t recognize the person I am now. 

Why am I doing this to myself? Why couldn’t I have just gotten out of bed and done something, anything?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: i accidentally made my username my name, so if you by some chance know me irl, please either don’t continue reading or don’t mention this post to me or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dealing with mental health issues for a couple of years now and at first, it was tolerable (and unnoticeable by friends and family) but it’s been a slippery slope and everything has just all gone wrong all at the same time. I don’t want to be one of those people that just assigns myself a mental illness, but idk what is wrong with me at this point. I don’t know what is causing me to do this stuff or why I am becoming increasingly self destructive and decreasingly self controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went abroad, made a lot of friends, and caused them to resent me by the end of the trip. My boyfriend and best friend who went with me were having trouble dealing with the burdens I put on them. I never meant to let it affect others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed out on opportunities of a lifetime while abroad by skipping free trips to historical sites and Mediterranean islands that the school organized. I just stopped feeling the motivation to get out of bed even though I spent those entire days hating myself and immediately regretting my decision, yet I still stayed in bed for the rest of the day, and then did the same thing when the next trip came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took out my anger on another best friend countless times because of random bouts of insecurity or paranoia or I don’t even know. She’s been very understanding through this but it’s not going to be easy to mend the relationship. I worry that she’s too fed up with my bullshit that she won’t even think it’s worth the effort to mend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent what feels like almost two entire semesters in bed. A lot of it was spent in my boyfriend’s bed because I hated being alone and, though he had a single bedroom, his roommates began to dislike me as they saw me as a moocher/lazy/intruding/etc. I could feel that they had thoughts like this towards me very early but I struggled to change my behavior. I have never been that girl that needs her boyfriend 24/7 and overstays her welcome and I hate that I did the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

Also on mobile so if it messes it up at all sorry. But I just need to get this off my brain. If the all just sounds like nonsense I'm sorry.

So about a week ago I had a friend message me say my other mother (she's my best friends mother) was have a hudge panic attack so I decided to see if her husban was sitting out front smoking to ask him the details of what happen. So me and my friend who had texted me about this worried brove by. 

No one was out front so we decided to go smoke a few stogs at our friend who only lives two blocks away. So after about a hour maybe two we both decided it was time to head back home cause the boyfriends were hunger. Well thankful we ended up changing our minds and swing back by my other mothers house.

Welp, didn't have to find her husban to find stuff out. We instead found her. Laying in her drive way... With a towel over her eyes... With blankets and a sweat shirt on. It's been getting really hot where I live so it was a sold 85°f out side. So we sit and talk with her for a sold 30 min. 

She's keeping a convo going but it is all stuff you wouldn't normally talk about with her. That lead the convo to her talking about the love of her life. Then it turns in and how she's going get ruined with him soon and that it felt like her bones were going though her skin. So we thought oh just a mental brake down.

She then goes Un responsive so me and my friend start to freak out. We don't know what to do cause she told us that last time she called emt they made her feel stupid. So while I'm trying to guess what to do she snap out of it and yells call 911. So we did........

At first every thing had started to go ok cops were talking to us full interaction. Then slow they just kinda stand there talk to each other looking at her like she's is a lonney. Not once did some one come over to me and ask if I was OK cause I was clearly have a panic attack. They even had the nerv to ask me if she a f***ING drugie.

Like 5 minutes after the cops show up the emts and fire truck did and he completely ignored us and wouldn't listen at all unless it was about something he asked. Luckly one of them kind listen to us but sadly he was the driver that night. So at this point I'm clueless of what they are doing with my other mother and just continue to ask me is she a meth crack ect user. The only drug I have ever seen her do in the last 15 years is pot.

We were told the emts will tell us where they are taking her and all that. Well while they are calming her I am checking on her husban. My friend who was with me kindly graved my mom's stuff and brought it into the house for me. The emts just took off and the cops were ten time more interested is what going on at the local meth hang out.

Well at this point me and my friend are so stressed out. So I find out they sent her home claiming it was just an anxiety attack and send her on her way so her husban take to a different one well the also treat her like crap saying nothings wrong with her blah blah blah. So goes and see her primary and they have found tumors all over. And I'm just siitng here tonight like if they had just stoped treating her like she's 2 they wouldn't have been as bad as they are.

I think the police know how badly the acted that night. tonight one of them fallowed me for a bit and another had sat in his car giving me dirt looks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello frist time poster ever. Also on mobile so if it messes it up at all sorry. But I just need to get this off my brain. If the all just sounds like nonsense I&amp;#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So about a week ago I had a friend message me say my other mother (she&amp;#39;s my best friends mother) was have a hudge panic attack so I decided to see if her husban was sitting out front smoking to ask him the details of what happen. So me and my friend who had texted me about this worried brove by. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one was out front so we decided to go smoke a few stogs at our friend who only lives two blocks away. So after about a hour maybe two we both decided it was time to head back home cause the boyfriends were hunger. Well thankful we ended up changing our minds and swing back by my other mothers house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welp, didn&amp;#39;t have to find her husban to find stuff out. We instead found her. Laying in her drive way... With a towel over her eyes... With blankets and a sweat shirt on. It&amp;#39;s been getting really hot where I live so it was a sold 85°f out side. So we sit and talk with her for a sold 30 min. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s keeping a convo going but it is all stuff you wouldn&amp;#39;t normally talk about with her. That lead the convo to her talking about the love of her life. Then it turns in and how she&amp;#39;s going get ruined with him soon and that it felt like her bones were going though her skin. So we thought oh just a mental brake down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then goes Un responsive so me and my friend start to freak out. We don&amp;#39;t know what to do cause she told us that last time she called emt they made her feel stupid. So while I&amp;#39;m trying to guess what to do she snap out of it and yells call 911. So we did........&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first every thing had started to go ok cops were talking to us full interaction. Then slow they just kinda stand there talk to each other looking at her like she&amp;#39;s is a lonney. Not once did some one come over to me and ask if I was OK cause I was clearly have a panic attack. They even had the nerv to ask me if she a f***ING drugie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like 5 minutes after the cops show up the emts and fire truck did and he completely ignored us and wouldn&amp;#39;t listen at all unless it was about something he asked. Luckly one of them kind listen to us but sadly he was the driver that night. So at this point I&amp;#39;m clueless of what they are doing with my other mother and just continue to ask me is she a meth crack ect user. The only drug I have ever seen her do in the last 15 years is pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told the emts will tell us where they are taking her and all that. Well while they are calming her I am checking on her husban. My friend who was with me kindly graved my mom&amp;#39;s stuff and brought it into the house for me. The emts just took off and the cops were ten time more interested is what going on at the local meth hang out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well at this point me and my friend are so stressed out. So I find out they sent her home claiming it was just an anxiety attack and send her on her way so her husban take to a different one well the also treat her like crap saying nothings wrong with her blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

 My mental mishaps start around the time I was in 5th grade, when my parents got divorced. My parents gave the normal talk about how they still loved us and wasn't our fault, that they just didn't love each other anymore and thought is was best to spend some time apart. As this was announced my sister did not cry, she just sat there quietly which I would later find out was her way of suppressing the emotions for later. I on the other hand had tears streaming down my face every drop causing me to go farther down into a pit of emotions. Though after that first spirt of emotions I just took them all and locked them away and box in a drawer which was in a desk in a safe and I left. 

 So, life went on and I moved out of my childhood home a rather large house with a big backyard into my dad's new small rental house with these odd teekies in the front yard, while my mother figured out where she would buy a new house. When I walked into my dad's house for the first time I was surprised, though not in a good way. There were boxes everywhere with all his junk in it along with an empty kitchen with a smelly old pantry and janky fridge (both were empty). After seeing that I thought it couldn't get worse I mean my bedroom can't be that bad. I walked over to my room and all that was there was a twin bed and empty white space that felt as if it hadn't been touched for centuries. The next week I came home from a visit to my mom to see that twin bed gone replaced with a bunk bed with only a top bunk and underneath there was a carpet, bean bag, tv mounted to the wall, and best of all an Xbox. I ran down the hall to my father thanking him profusely where he just smiled and said, ""Thomas and I picked this stuff up while you were gone because we thought your room seemed a little dull."" My delight would soon turn to sadness. My sister came home from school and all she did was yell at me and with pure hatred in her eyes she ripped my tv off the wall and let it fall to the ground. I never found out why she did such a thing, but I think she was angry that she didn't get a tv.

 Not much went on at my mom's new place. By the time she got her house I was used to a small house and was not surprised when I saw it. My sister didn't act up at that house ,so at least I felt safe from a constant onslaught of words there with my mother shielding me from her hate taking it on all by herself. Since then I have always hated myself for not even lifting a finger trying to help the situation, but at the time I didn't understand or even know how to deal with a situation like that. 

 Fast-forward a year and my dad has a house of his own. He is a very well off man making upwards of 6 digits a year. The house he bought was in the most expensive neighborhood in Austin. I loved the new house, but as time went on my sister fell into a deep hole of drugs and anger while I retained mental damage from her as my father went through a midlife crises. When my father was going through this change he seemed to forget I existed along with my sister. First a regular supply of food stopped coming, then dinner stopped coming completely as well as breakfast. I would only have lunch at school that he made for me because he had to keep his public image up. The only time I would ever get dinner was when he brought home guests and once again he had to keep his public image safe, so he made dinner and acknowledged that I existed. I would be forced to put on an act for his new friends because in my head I thought there wouldn't be any lunch if I didn't act like a normal kid. I especially couldn't have the school lunches because I was almost deathly allergic to wheat and dairy which is in everything. Eventually he started giving my sister his credit card so that we could go shopping and get food for ourselves. I was a kid, so all I did was buy junk food that I would eat in massive amounts causing me to develop an eating disorder where I would constantly eat. Even today I am still stuck in that loop of eating and eating and eating. The mental issues with the tension of home life just kept building and building on itself and those emotions that I locked away, so long ago started seeping out until the safe blew open overloaded with emotions and mental stress. So, I went further into that pit that had now turned into a black hole eating up everything in sight. I was sent into deep depression which I'm still enveloped in, even now.

 The year is now 2019 and I'm still suffering from all these issues and mental stress that keeps building up. I am currently only 15, so I still have more time stuck in this place, but when I get out I hope my life can change for the better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a throwaway account due to unrelated reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

In 2016 he got out went to school for 2 years then got a job with Raytheon in Dallas. It was a contract position with an auto renewal after 6 month and we were told most people were brought on to salary after a year. He turned down another job offer to accept the position in Dallas. He signed a contract for 115k per year in December 2018. We rented a house for 2200 per month and borrowed 10k from his mom to move half way across the country. 

He was supposed to start on December 3 of 2018, they pushed it back to the 10th and on the 7th they called and said the government had upped the security clearance level required to work the contract. They put in the request for the government to up  my hubby's clearance level and said call us back first of year you should be good to go. At the first of the year they were still waiting on the government. We started pulling money out of retirment to pay rent. I am a massage therapist and my license took two months to transfer so I also wasn't able to bring in any money. We waited for another 4 months calling each week with the promise ' nothing yet but as soon as your clearance is approved by the gov you will be good to go."" 

At the beginning of April his clearance was approved. We though okay thank god its over. He called them the following monday and didn't get a response back for a week. When they did respond they told us the project manager wasn't answering HRs emails or phone calls and hadn't been for a month. They couldn't do anything to get him started in the position until the project manager responded. In the meantime he was a top priority and they would try to find him another position. That has been the same response twice aweek for the last month.

We couldn't move to cheaper house because we didn't have no proof of income. My hubby applied to over 250 jobs and got responses that he was over qualified but no interviews. Finally after applying to any job paying between 50 and 20 an hour, he has accepted a job for minimum wage just so we can keep the lights on. Last week we pulled our last bit out of retirment savings. Luckily I'm also now able to work. Today he got a call about a job that will pay well but will mean he will be deployed for 11 months straight.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hubby was in the military for 8 years.

&lt;p&gt;He was supposed to start on December 3 of 2018, they pushed it back to the 10th and on the 7th they called and said the government had upped the security clearance level required to work the contract. They put in the request for the government to up  my hubby&amp;#39;s clearance level and said call us back first of year you should be good to go. At the first of the year they were still waiting on the government. We started pulling money out of retirment to pay rent. I am a massage therapist and my license took two months to transfer so I also wasn&amp;#39;t able to bring in any money. We waited for another 4 months calling each week with the promise &amp;#39; nothing yet but as soon as your clearance is approved by the gov you will be good to go.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of April his clearance was approved. We though okay thank god its over. He called them the following monday and didn&amp;#39;t get a response back for a week. When they did respond they told us the project manager wasn&amp;#39;t answering HRs emails or phone calls and hadn&amp;#39;t been for a month. They couldn&amp;#39;t do anything to get him started in the position until the project manager responded. In the meantime he was a top priority and they would try to find him another position. That has been the same response twice aweek for the last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t move to cheaper house because we didn&amp;#39;t have no proof of income. My hubby applied to over 250 jobs and got responses that he was over qualified but no interviews. Finally after applying to any job paying between 50 and 20 an hour, he has accepted a job for minimum wage just so we can keep the lights on. Last week we pulled our last bit out of retirment savings. Luckily I&amp;#39;m also now able to work. Today he got a call about a job that will pay well but will mean he will be deployed for 11 months straight.&lt;/p&gt;

If I'd met her at a bar, I wouldn't have bought her a second drink; as it were, when I met her, she looked a LITTLE like Anna Kendrick, .....and I apparently lost my mind. I was basically drunk from when I broke up with her until I met #3. #3 pulled me out of a really dark place.... she was also married. I fell HARD for her... she's one of a kind. I resolved to box my feelings up - wouldn't have been fair to her to tell her how I felt.... until she called me to tell me she was hopelessly in love with me. Girl of my dreams....into me...married.

For me it’s this girl , we were friends very very close friends but never in the dirty way despite the opinions of many at the time she was only 14 and I was 20 we met through my hobby  which was photography and she was heavily into the modelling so we spent a fair bit of time together doing photoshoots , over the space of two years we did a lot of photoshoots with all sorts of themes to it and the images  ended up in  quite a few modelling magazines internationally,  

she had issues at school making friends because people were at the school were very judgemental over the modelling and teased her a lot over it but she stuck at it and over the space of two years roughly we developed a very close friendship we talked every single day morning lunch dinner she knew my life inside out and I knew hers and more than a few times she cried on my shoulder,

But she was a girl going through the puberty stage and boys at her school started getting an interest , our friendship survived two boyfriends ( despite their best efforts )

Her third boyfriend was probably the biggest tool he hated me and the friendship between her and i and as a result she got to a point where she gave into the pressure and stopped talking to me , for weeks I tried talking to her , her mum was worried because she wasn’t talking to her either.  Things really went south Just before her 16th we ended up in an argument and  I found out that her much younger boyfriend had been sending her pictures of his penis ,he was 13 nearly 14 at the time he put so much pressure and stress on her to send him something back so she did  and she regretted it but she felt trapped ,  she begged me not to tell her mother or father but having seen this kind of situation go horribly wrong before i ended up sending the boy a message saying I would tell her mother and father about what been going on , the situation blew up and he turned it into a story about me blackmailing him and her to break up and a heap of other crap which I’m still finding out bits and pieces of today ,  
I sat her parents down and told them what had happened , they were quite supportive and thankful that I had done something 

In her eyes though I had betrayed her in a big way ( the boyfriend also as it turned out made up a whole heap of other lies which is why she stopped talking me earlier in the peace)  her parents got hold of the boys parents
 and the boys mother took action and wiped everything his phone pc tablet etc 

At the time I knew that there was a possibility it would end the friendship but I figured I could live with it as long as she was safe from him and shortly after her 16th she was .

It’s been 1 year 6 months and 11 days since she’s spoken to me in any civil way, most of the time when I’m over there I see her sisters and her mum , but she doesn’t really talk outside of hello  , I’ve tried so many times to talk to her but she just says there is nothing to talk about , her mums tried and just ends up in an argument her sisters too

I have loved my job from the first day along with all of my coworkers. We are a small office of 6 employees in office and one employee who primarily works from home. We know each other pretty well. Two weeks ago, we found out two of our coworkers are leaving. One has already left, and one will be leaving the middle of this month.

Since coworker #1 has left, I have unofficially adopted her duties until her replacement is trained. Coworker #1 was the office manager/contact lens tech, so I have become the ""go-to"" person for everything. For the most part, I have been enjoying staying busy all day. HOWEVER, my remaining coworkers have adopted this new attitude where they come to me for everything they need help with, but don't issue me any type of respect or appreciation for stepping up and helping out in this way. 

It's really bothering me because I'm doing the jobs of two people and even though everyone is acting like I'm the office manager, if they want time off or adjustments to their schedule they go above my head. Example, coworker #3 (who is not leaving as an employee) wants a few days off at the end of this month to see her daughter who lives out of state. I am totally fine with this, but the days she wants off are going to directly impact my ability to do my job. She is our front desk person, and I am her replacement when she is gone. One of the days in particular, has already been signed off by two other employees, so we will now have a grand total of 3 people to run the entire office all day. My boss is a doctor, so he doesn't realize all of the work that goes on behind the scenes on the administration side of things to ensure a smooth office flow. He gave coworker #3 the OK to take off the days, so now I just have to hold on to as many pieces as I have left and hope nothing else is taken away. 

I'm not able to perform my job in the front area because it isn't HIPAA compliant in the way my job requires. I'm the insurance coordinator, so I regularly call insurance companies to find coverage information. I have to provide names, dates of birth, insurance IDs, and sometimes their addresses. In other words, it would be a massive HIPAA violation for me to DO MY JOB in the front area. But don't worry, because I'LL GET TO BE THE OFFICE MANAGER TOOO!

So anyways, I'm irked that she went to the doctor first then essentially *told* me what days she was going to take off. I sent my boss an email and asked what I was supposed to do for insurance while I was up there, but not only has he not responded to me - he is also ignoring me in every context. He literally won't even look at me. I get to pick up the slack, but I don't get to have any say in it whatsoever. 

All of this (plus more) happened this week, and today, man, I couldn't hide the toll it's taking on me. I am stressed out. I don't have time to work ahead verifying insurance, and I am working my absolute hardest to make sure everything is done by 5pm. Before I took on all these duties, I was the person always happy and making everyone laugh. Today, my coworkers start asking me what's wrong because I don't seem like myself. Well no shit, I don't get any breaks and every minute of every day is occupied before I even set foot in the door that morning. But, I told them it is tough getting everything done and got to work. Later, 3 of my coworkers were trying to talk to me about non work related topics, but they took it personally (even though I was still polite and cordial) when I said that I didn't want to have a personal conversation because I was busy. For the rest of the day, I got to hear how I need to be happier while simultaneously doing all of the work that nobody else was willing to do. Plus, I have a lot of childhood trauma resurfacing so as I'm working I have a total of 6 fucked up, horror filled memories resurface throughout the day.

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants different things and unfortunately what he wants does not line up with what I want.  To make it worse, this is my first boyfriend in a while.  I didn&amp;#39;t date for a long time after my fiance died.  My fiance was the love of my life and while everyone in my family is happy and settled, I&amp;#39;m alone and no one wants to be with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t expect any advice or easy solutions.  I just want to cry and get all of this out so I can move on.&lt;/p&gt;

Last summer, right before entering my junior year of university, I decided I needed a break and to move out of state to be closer with my parents. I had lived with my aunt for just under two years (paying rent) and then moved cities to go to my university, where I stayed for a year and a half. 

I realized I wasn't doing well mentally and emotionally a while before I moved to uni, but I have been raised to not speak up about it. I Internalized everything and went about life, thinking I'd work on me and get through school on my own. I didn't want to burden anyone, and in fact, it didn't occur to me to even try.

I realize i shouldn't have lied so many times in telling my family members that I was fine and all was fine and life was fine and so on. I would be hurt in their positions were someone to do it to me.

I told them in July, through a long, thought out, explanatory letter what i had been dealing with, the steps I was going to take, and how I was going to proceed from that point. I went into detail about everything as best s I could.

My mom was grateful that I spoke up to her and would be moving, as I hoped and thought she would. My aunt and grandmother were less ecstatic. 

They became convinced that I had been manipulating them, the government, and anyone else who had helped me so I could go to school and get benefits (I had some scholarships and was given some technology to help me through school). They accused me of lying to them so as to attain more time, energy, money, and supplies before jumping ship when life got a little too tough.

I was further accused that the only reason I wanted to move was to be closer to my boyfriend. I sat with my aunt for 10 minutes while she tried to force me to just admit to it, even after I told her with no uncertainty that that was not the reason and that to admit to it would be the lie. She never believed me. She's to this day convinced that it's why I moved.

I was told that everyone at this point in college goes through some tough stuff and they all have to suck it up and deal with it. I was borderline suicidal, self harming, utterly isolated from any form of social contact (self inflicted), failing courses because i had absolutely no energy for them. I am a high achieving person. My cat is literally the reason I'm still alive today.

Though I'd been seeking therapy at this point, I was accused of most likely lying about that because how could they trust anything that came out of my mouth if I was able to tell them I was ok for so long when I wasn't.

I was forced to apologize to them for not telling them the truth. Idk why they wanted an insincere apology, but they forced it out of me.

Because I avoid confrontation at all costs, I allowed them to get it out of their systems and move on as normal. I've had limited contact with them over the last few months, and my talks with them are casual, surface level, and distant because I can't stomach the thought of anything else.

Today my aunt called to catch up, and while the majority of the conversation was friendly and lighthearted, she jokingly told me that they have renamed my old room the ""dropout room"". I was going to tell her that my FAFSA is submitted and I'm looking into courses, but at that point i was just done. I'm so done.

I am unwilling to cut her out because the guilt of doing so would be stronger than my feelings about it now, which are already strong. 

I'm in therapy. I moved. I am seeking my degree. I am bettering myself, learning about myself, and becoming myself. I don't need her support, and I was able to let that comment wash over me tonight more than I ever have been before. She's going to judge me, and that's fine. I don't need to accept it.

I would like to smack her with my diploma when I receive it, though.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway because i&amp;#39;m too cowardly for them to know I&amp;#39;ve said any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

First, my nephew (kid of a close family friend) texts me to say that he is doing a fundraiser for his high school choir group tour and they are accepting donations. No problem! Have $75 kid! You go live that high school life I never did because I was boring in high school. 

Then, shortly thereafter, my sister contacts me. Her roommate moved to another state for work last month and she hasn't been able to fill the room. She can't afford the double rent, so could baby brother ""lend"" her $1400. When is it due? Tomorrow? Okay. Things happen. BabyBro's got your back! 

Then, I get home from work at about 10:00pm. I just wanted to go to sleep, so I went directly to my room. Five minutes later, my brother/roommate knocks on my door. With teeth grit, I bid him to come in and he informs me that he hasn't been paid for a job he did in April, so he can't cover his end of the rent. He asks if I can afford both ends?

I'm moving 1800 miles away in 2 days. 

I just got off the phone with my mom, who is the only person in my family who didn't come to the farewell cookout we had because she HAD to go into work on her day off. I wanted to see her again before I leave and invited her to come over while we're packing and we can order food and hang out for a bit. She said she can't because work (a nice Italian restaurant) received a customer complaint and she HAS to go in and deal with it on her day off. Again. She asked me to come visit her at work. Im carless because I sold it and have zero time to be traveling a city over to see my mom at work for 15 minutes while she rushes around, making drinks, helping servers, and ignoring me. She's the manager (among 2 other managers who can also do those exact things). She started crying on the phone about how much she will miss me and that it's such a shame I can't come see her. I invited her over tomorrow (another day off) and she said maybe, if she feels up to it.

Background:

My mom was an alcoholic who left when I was 8. I'm now 27. My dad raised me and my siblings while still trying to help her get sober, taking her to rehab and paying for her stays even though he could hardly afford food. She eventually quit drinking several years ago, but ever since, she has been nothing but a flake who traded alcohol for work and neglects us, while simultaneously playing victim and sending us on guilt trips almost every single time we ever see her.

I've lived 30 minutes away for 10 years. She has come to visit me exactly twice. Once for my college graduation, where she hugged me, said she had a headache, and skipped going to lunch with me because she had to go home. The second was for Christmas two years ago. She left early again. I went to visit her at least once a month, usually at work because that's where she always is and because I hate going to her house due to her creepy, paranoid, anorexic boyfriend who screamed at my sister on her wedding day and told me to never have kids because I cuss too much. She always buys a present for him for holidays and makes sign it and pretend it's from us because he gets sad over the holidays. He's a jahovah witness. 

Here are just a few things from the past, among a million others:

For two years, she completely bailed on Christmas and Thanksgiving. 

I took her out to lunch a few weeks ago and she spent the entire time alternating between showing me bigoted sermons on her phone (she knows I'm an atheist), trying to convince me to like Donald Trump, telling me global warming isn't real, and bawling about how she wasn't there for me when I was a kid. I pointed out that she's here now and I just want to have a nice lunch, and she cried harder.

When I was younger, I got a scholarship to travel to Europe for a few weeks and receive educational credits. She wanted to take me shopping for some clothes before I went. We went to old navy and she had a crying meltdown in the middle of the store because I wanted a $8 tank top and she thought that was outrageous. Then she took me to dollar general for clothes and all I got was a pack of men's t-shirts. I told me dad and he took me shopping. 

She came to a handful of my band concerts in high school, but almost always left halfway through. 

Both my parents came to pick me up at the airport from a short term study abroad trip I took in college. I was almost totally broke when I got back due to the exchange rate, but my dad sensed it and gave me $40 for some gas and a few groceries until I stared getting paychecks again. She yelled at me and told me I am an ungrateful moocher and should never, ever be asking my dad for money at my age. I was 22 and had received no financial support from either of them for 4 years. I didn't even ask for it. He just gave it to me because he is my parent who loves me and wants me to be ok. 

She never paid a cent of child support because my dad never asked for it. When I was a younger kid, we struggled a lot to the point where I was doing homework by candlelight and we would go days without water due to utilities being shut off. My parents lost their flourishing business when she started drinking and they divorced, yet she never even acknowledged this. If I needed help she would just guilt trip me from a very young age. I quit asking for help and am just now starting to realize that I'm not weak, useless, and ungrateful for needing it. 

She continues to chain smoke, even though she can barely walk 50 steps without being completely out of breath. She needs to be on a respirator on disability, but she somehow continues to work 50 hours a week at a job that should be paying her $70k/year+. She barely makes minimum wage. The owner has been in trouble for labor issues in the past and really should be in jail, but she adamantly defends him and refuses to ever stand up for herself. She doesn't seem to realize that her job is costing her what remains of her relationship with her three kids. She just likes the abuse and doesn't think about how her unyielding loyalty to work hurts other people who want her to be present as a mom. 

I tried so hard for so many years to make my mom feel better about herself. I only recently realized that I'm not the one that failed her, she failed me. The way she talked and cried and guilt tripped me made me feel like a bad daughter for a long, long time and I don't even know if it was intentional. I never visited enough, I never called enough, my beliefs and views on the world and on religion weren't hers and it upset her, I struggled financially and it was an indicator that I wasn't trying hard enough. 

And at this point, I forgive her for everything and have told her that, but she doesn't forgive herself and never will. She is addicted to being a miserable victim and doesn't even seem to realize how badly it hurts me and my siblings. I'm so tired of it and just want a normal mom who wants to see me and have a normal conversation with me and may actually even take the initiative to do something nice for me. I bring her flowers and chocolate every year for mothers day, her birthday, and valentines day. She just calls me on my birthday and complains about work, then hurriedly gets off the phone.

My mother in law is the mom I never had. She drives 3 hours to visit us at least once a month by her own will (we visit her too). She makes jewelry for me and talks to me about my aspirations. She encourages me and if we need help, she helps us in whatever way she can. It amazes me and Im still blown away that a mom is like that. I feel selfish and bad when she tells me to just leave my dish by the sink or gives me a nice gift for Christmas. I almost had a panic attack when she helped us pay for our wedding because I never knew how to repay her or if I could ever show enough gratitude. My husband told me we don't have to repay her. That love isn't a transaction. Just love her back. I never knew about that.

So my mom sucks. A lot. And I can't wait to get away from here so I don't have the constant, nagging guilt in the back of my mind telling me I need to go visit my mom or she will be sad. It isn't my responsibility to make her happy, especially when she has caused so much hurt.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long one. &lt;/p&gt;

There are so many types of hooks that you need. It’s quite stressful but also fun (for a job) since the sheets they give you are basically puzzles for you to find the pieces and stick them into the large wooden walls. 
What’s not fun is that every. Single. Piece. Is wrapped in plastic. The hundreds of 2ft by 1ft shelves used in one store all had a plastic wrapper. The smaller things, like hooks, came like 50 in a box, but they all together had a chunky plastic wrapper, and there’s gotta be way over a thousand in the store...and those are just hooks. There’s baskets, basket walls, tacks for signs, zip ties...etc. they all come in a squeaky plastic bag.
At first I thought “well it must be getting recycled.” No. It’s all thrown away.  I did some piddly research and the types of plastic all the packaging is made out of is either PET or LDPE I believe? 
Many packages have big styrofoam pieces. They are tied up into even larger plastic bags and thrown away, which I guess is better than nothing as they’re probably told to do that so the styrofoam doesn’t break apart, but man.
The amount of bins with plastic after just one day of unwrapping necessary shelving pieces was....unimaginable.  These bins were at least 4ft cubed, and 4-5 after each workday were opaque white from all the scronched plastic bags inside. The styrofoam bags had separate bins. 
All I know is that when I asked what happens to the plastic, I got back “in the trash.” 

This is one store, so it just puts things in perspective.

Really wish this was emphasized in school. Everyone is so much onto the ""a single idea can change the world,"" cue the flowers and holding hands bit, that it is misleading and can cause some painful disillusionment in adulthood. 

Point out people who had great ideas before their time and were thus ignored and unsuccessful, or that there were people with crappy ideas compared to their contemporaries but who prevailed due to execution (not literally, sit down Stalin). Show how the patent and copyright systems are flawed and how it favors moneyed, established interests over the new guy. Acknowledge that there will always be powerful people with a powerful stake in the status quo and against change and that, failing that, great ideas are smothered for dumb, completely arbitrary reasons every day. Present the unflinching, often life-crushing sacrifice often required of those who do see their ideas to fruition, and the same or greater sacrifice from the many more who don't. 

You can go too far the other way,  granted, but to omit all of that altogether is just setting people up for repeated, painful, and, most importantly, unnecessary failure. You can be encouraging and supportive without sugarcoating the challenges, both personal and societal, that lay ahead.

my other friends don't really care they think I'm just not interested in relationship stuff cause that's true I'm not interested in heterosexual relationships. after suffering for a long time I had to take a decision and stick to it. 


so I've take my decision that I will live for ever alone. with time I started to accept this fact. I'm actually thinking about adopting 3 cats and a dog. I really love animals. I want to help people. I'd like to do more Volunteer work in the future.

I've not taken many, if any, major risks, never had a reckless or rebellious period, and have done pretty much everything I can to avoid danger and drama, to the point where I often manage to make myself socially invisible if I so wish.

&amp;#x200B;

But part of me keeps thinking about how I'd be and how my life would be if I walked a different path. If I took chances with various girls I met at uni, or was more daring in my time there, instead of cowering away due to fear of rejection. If I tried other hobbies I was always scared to go for like martial arts, due to how bad I am at dealing with pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever other people talk about their lives and their past, it always sounds so exciting and ridiculous, and then I think about the stuff that's happened to me and just think ""I must be the most dull human being I'll ever know"". I don't feel like I've accomplished anything - I'm nothing special in either a positive or negative way, and I'm just sort of...there. Sometimes, I even wonder if it would matter much if I just phased out of existence for a couple days and wonder if people would really miss me. I wonder if my life would be different if I just changed some of my choices or took a few leaps of faith. I wonder if my life would be better or worse - if I'd be happier or more miserable, and I can't help feeling that it'd be better to have known what would happen, even if the outcome would have been terrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't even muster up the ability to talk to my girlfriend today. I really enjoy talking to her, but I just felt like such a failure of a human being that I had no idea what to talk about. I don't think I deserve her, and I have no idea why she stays with a dullard like me - she could have anyone.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t really think I&amp;#39;ve had an exciting life, and doubt I ever really will. I&amp;#39;ve not taken many, if any, major risks, never had a reckless or rebellious period, and have done pretty much everything I can to avoid danger and drama, to the point where I often manage to make myself socially invisible if I so wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But part of me keeps thinking about how I&amp;#39;d be and how my life would be if I walked a different path. If I took chances with various girls I met at uni, or was more daring in my time there, instead of cowering away due to fear of rejection. If I tried other hobbies I was always scared to go for like martial arts, due to how bad I am at dealing with pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever other people talk about their lives and their past, it always sounds so exciting and ridiculous, and then I think about the stuff that&amp;#39;s happened to me and just think &amp;quot;I must be the most dull human being I&amp;#39;ll ever know&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;ve accomplished anything - I&amp;#39;m nothing special in either a positive or negative way, and I&amp;#39;m just sort of...there. Sometimes, I even wonder if it would matter much if I just phased out of existence for a couple days and wonder if people would really miss me. I wonder if my life would be different if I just changed some of my choices or took a few leaps of faith. I wonder if my life would be better or worse - if I&amp;#39;d be happier or more miserable, and I can&amp;#39;t help feeling that it&amp;#39;d be better to have known what would happen, even if the outcome would have been terrible. &lt;/p&gt;

Oh poor fucking you! If God really does exist and he's trying to give you stuff you can handle he must have just sighed and turned the dial down going ""Wow they are weaker than I thought!""

One person who left said that ""they thought this was a Christian play and they wanted their money back"" it is a fucking Christian play, you small minded dolt! Stay until the end! If you cut out of a play early any of your opinions are invalid. You have given up and forfeitted any right to talk about the play with any authority. To put it in terms they would understand that's the equivalent to having strong feelings on The Last Supper painting despite only  having ever seen 3 apostles on the end. 

Going back to my original point about thin skinned Christians. As an atheist  I have encountered many things that go against what I beleive in. This play for instance! I don't beleive in the divine at all! I regularly go to art museums that display religious artwork. I am just generally around religious people who wear their religion proudly on their sleeve. And you don't see me stomping around, throwing my program in the trash and demanding my money back because my feelings got hurt, I was made mildly uncomfortable for 10 seconds, or I encountered a person who wasn't a 100% clone of myself. 

I just can't fucking stand people who are so thin skined and yet purport to be much stronger than me because of their faith.

Look no further than a mirror.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sick of Christians I know going on endlessly about how much they endure and how strong they have to be to be a Christian and how God doesn&amp;#39;t give you anything you can&amp;#39;t handle and then absolutely crumbling at the first sign the whole world isn&amp;#39;t exactly like them. 
Specifically I&amp;#39;m referring to Christians getting up and leaving a play in disgust because a religious figure says &amp;quot;fuck&amp;quot; and then tell me &amp;quot;they just don&amp;#39;t need to expose themselves to that kind of filth&amp;quot;  (the play is The Last Days of Judas Iscariot and the character is Saint Monica) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh poor fucking you! If God really does exist and he&amp;#39;s trying to give you stuff you can handle he must have just sighed and turned the dial down going &amp;quot;Wow they are weaker than I thought!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

to walk faster. i thought it was worth it because i was seeing a band i loved, so we planned to go to a third concert. we camped outside the arena one night and we were fine, and then in the morning we had to pack our tent up and i had no idea how to put it together because she set it up, and she was pissed and made me carry it, the tent was heavy as shit and i was struggling the entire walk to her car and she was yelling at me the whole walk, honestly i repressed most of what she said but it was all insults and attacking me because i struggle with going to school, by the time we got to the car i realized what a huge mistake i had made and how the concert wasn’t worth it in the first place, so i didn’t want to go. i put the tent in her trunk and got in her car and refused to get out. she yelled at me, tried pulling me out, i had 2 week old acrylic stiletto nails so i dug my nails into her arm and she punched me a couple times and broke 3 or 4 of my nails. at this point my nose was bleeding and i was snapping pics for evidence, and she called my mom and my mom and dad were yelling at me to get of the car but i just refused and didn’t tell them she hit me. wow this is one run on

So I’m 13 and in a family of 7 people and 7 pets. My dad is gone more than like %80 of our lives (because of work) and therefore he doesn’t know much about family and support. My mom owns a small private school and I, along with every one except my youngest sister goes, and just to add to that my mom just got a hip surgery and is still recovering and so she uses it as an excuse for us to do more stuff for her. My oldest brother has adhd and anxiety and bothers everyone a lot so he stays home most of the time. My older sister blackmails me and covers it up with lies ( also just wanted to point out I want as many things to be as fair as possible) and also owes my parents a lot of money cuz she said she would pay it back in VERY VERY small increments and one more thing, 2 of the dogs are hers but she bothers them and makes others take care of them. Onto me, I have an auditory processing thing where I can’t process what others say sometimes and I also have depression and a lot of (because of the fam/pressure) STs (suicidal thoughts) but I don’t say anything to anyone ( including the therapist at school) cuz all they say is how if I actually might kms I have to be taken to a place where they can make sure I don’t. My young-ER sister has depression too so she “super sensitive” and cries at anything and she own all three cats but doesn’t care for them either. On tothe little devil that is my young-EST sister that, whenever she defies the rules she simply is told never to do it again even though when we’re caught doing something nowhere as bad as her we get punished for days, she also is super spoiled and anytime she gets angry cuz of an electronic device ( like her own phone) she instinctively throws it at the ground so yeah. I think I need someone like a girlfriend that could understand me in a way where I can share any/all of my secrets to someone without be severely judged and I just want someone to appreciate me for all of my flaws/quirks (which I have too many of) and be able to hang out any day of the week and just vent cuz then I would feel way more comfortable without bearing so many secrets alone.

I love the job. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I have found my new career. Anywho. So I made a post on facebook about how I had a brain fart and was freaking out because I was missing a part of my schedule. Turns out I&amp;#39;m an idiot and the missing days were a 3 day weekend. The post was just a barebones &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m stupid because I&amp;#39;ve been searching for a schedule for x dates, but I don&amp;#39;t have a schedule for x dates because it&amp;#39;s the weekend and I&amp;#39;m off&amp;quot; with a meme I&amp;#39;d pulled somewhere that was a screencap of a program saying &amp;quot;Task Failed Successfully&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not 5 mins after I&amp;#39;ve made the post one of my coworkers who I&amp;#39;ve kinda known for a couple of years messaged me and was like getting on to me for sharing a picture of my work screen and sharing it to social media. Like I would be that fucking stupid. I&amp;#39;m not risking my career over a meme/joke. I won&amp;#39;t even charge my phone using my work computer. I know and follow my policies, and me mentioning that I couldn&amp;#39;t find my assignments because I have those days off does not break policy as it gives no information about my company or what I even do. (I am allowed to say what I am and where I work but it&amp;#39;s preferred that we stay DL.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so frustrated that she would think I was that stupid. She only ever talks to me when she want a to correct me on something(she&amp;#39;s usually wrong). And just ugh. I hate people like that.&lt;/p&gt;

Sounds like a basic statement but it carries a lot of weight. Going through a move to my inlaws old home, packed them up and moved them to their other apartment. 

Also at easter day my husband and his bro got into a huge fight,  I feel it may of severed their relationship. 
More things transpired and their mom is having a psychotic or delusional episode where she is basically gaslighting my husband in the way in which she is siding with his brother.

Basically in a nutshell, my husband is the youngest  of 3, and is 5 years younger than his brother. 
They are 1.5 generation immigrants from eastern europe. So idk. They have some anger issues, all of them. I mean generations raised  by alcoholics. 

So as a boy my husband was basically his brother'sservant. Like make him tea, sandwiches, rub his back, always get the second choice and the handmedown, because on top of it they were really poor. It was a lot of control issuesand coming to america probably didn't make the experience better.
Anyway the husband kinda followed in his brother's shadow liking similar things going down similar career paths, but lately the last 2 years husband has stopped looking up to his brother and idolizing him and realize he is treated like crap emotionally. On easter dinner husband reached his boiling point when he accidently triggered his brother. I even felt the shift in vibe, likea crossing of a line, even though it was totally irrational. Afterit was a bunch of passive aggressive outdoing one another, then the explosion. 


Anyway my husband is a mama's boy, totally and the favorite. His mother also loves me a lot too. But she is acting like all the years of emotional abuse and control didn't occur even though I have had convos with her about this same topic. 
It is totally delusional, and I'd say damaging.

Anyway. With this move and bills and all that both husband and I are broke and both of course overdrafted our accounts. Literally living negative money and no food. 
Well we were going to his mom's for dinner but given the drama probably isn't goingto happen.
Been selling stuff I was going to donate to just get some cash money. Literally at a BK rodeo Cheeseburgerlast night for dinner. Spent my last $1.50 on that...fuckmy life. 

I know I was a bit vague with the argument it just is so exhausting to type that bit cuz my husband is fuming about it all every time I see him. 

My biggest fear is his mother getting so triggered she kicks us out of the house we just moved into out of pure spite. 
Finals are about to happen,  I'm about to graduate.  Can't even afford my robes lol.

It makes me sad, jealous, feel inadequate, feel less important as a person. I feel like no matter what, I am measuring myself and my accomplishments vs others and no amount of feeling bad about it means anything or helps me do anything any more than what I am now. It’s a fuckin miracle I have the drive to even work out the way I have been recently. My drives, my ambition - they are empty. My drive is not to be a fucking leech my entire life. My goal is to not fuck up on a daily basis. Those are 2 sickeningly terrible and low reaching aspirations to carry.

I feel as though If I am not a burden to others then I will be happy. It all is about my impact on other people.

I’m sitting here in my work bathroom wallowing. About what? This started because I feel an intense jealousy because my girlfriend who is 3 Yeats younger than me had a more full life than I do. I am weighing my happiness vs someone else’s even worse some who I feel I love deeply. This feeling will result in anger if I don’t do anything about making myself more happy.

Even if I feel I find a direction to go in, I’m deeply afraid that this empty feeling will persist. It will be clawing toward the top of a mountain that has no end in sight. Or even worse, I see a peak in the distance but come to realize there’s nothing but a steep cliff on the other side. And that really is what life is. For all who see purpose in it. So I can either choose to create my own purpose, or float. Day by day. Hoping I can rest easy between the days. And hoping I don’t get carried away by a strong breeze out of my control or completely halted due to the weight of my own hangups.

I am literally making myself sick judging my own accomplishments vs my girlfriend. It feels extremely low from an outside perspective. It feels like if I was listening to someone vent about this to me, I would tell them to NUT THE FUCK UP AND SHUT THE FUCK UP AND FIGURE OUT YOUR FUCKING LIFE. The problem with that is I know I have the support and resources. My inability to act comes from a deep desire to not disappoint myself but even worse those around me. I am boring and inambitious and directionless because of these feelings. Do I need medication? Do I need help? I feel the need to figure it out in my own and I truly believe I can do it on my own. But i don’t even do 2 steps forward and 1 step back. They’re hardly baby steps. But they are steps. 

I am also consistently checking where Britney is on share my location - is it because I don’t trust her? Is it my jealousy? I’d say both. She is meeting people who I am putting in a pedestal because of the materialistic things they stand for, working for one of the largest brands in the world. I never saw myself as a brand-whore or materialistic but I must be. They could be the absolute worst people on the face of the earth, I don’t know that. But I’m just assuming they are 10x more inspirational, motivated, smart and ambitious than I am. Born to the right family? Sure. More motivated through school? Maybe. Are they worth the pain and jealous my I am causing myself even if they are those things? Absolutely fucking not. 

I can choose to be this self-wallowing, jealous, vain, introverted, shy, nerd, directionless fuckwad that is never pleased. 

Or I can be the independent, forward facing, motivated, driven and intense person that I see and admire in other people. 

What is that thing that I know I can find and dedicate time and energy on?

I need to use one day a week on researching things to make my life more driven and focused. Painting, arts, research, music, my next job, helping other people, helping animals, teaching, physical, out in the world shit. If I can make money doing it, awesome. But I need more inspiration. I need more focus. I need more drive. I can’t sit back and wait for that to come to me like I have been for 26 years. I am stronger than wait and see. No one can help me do this and start doing it other than me. 

Keep this monologue going. I feel better that it’s out of my head.

I dont get invited to the pool parties, or when they go out to eat. I didn't get invited to the sleepover. It just makes me sad. I know it's because I have old lady hobbies even though I'm 24, it still just makes me sad. 
I tried to Express this to my boyfriend of two years and he just tells me that I shouldn't be trying to make friends at work. Like, I get it, at your job you are a a manager, but people like you everywhere you go. 

And then he just makes me feel so bad sometimes. He manages a local pet store, and so today, I took his dog in to see him. He was happy to see her, but not super happy to see me. I figured it was just that he was at work. I knew I would be passing the store when  he was on lunch, so I stopped back by knowing he would be leaving the premises, he was super annoyed. He sat in my car and stared at his phone, pushing me away when I wanted a kiss. 
He later texted to say he was sleepy and that was why he was in a bad mood. But he was in a bad mood when I went to surprise him after work last night. We have both been sick, and his mom is in the hospital. Maybe I shouldn't have go over but I thought maybe we could use an hour together to.... I dont know decompress. 

Tonight I was feeling so bad about everything I messaged someone on 7 cups of tea, and while I wanted to talk about work, the listener quickly turned the conversation to asking me if I was intimate with my boyfriend. Which if we are being honest, it's not as often as I would like because having depression has lowered his drive.  

It just makes me sad not having anyone to talk to sometimes. It makes me angry that I'm still such a leper.

It was my second year of uni, and I was having my ""student mid-life crisis"", and for reasons that are still a mystery to me I began having feelings of hypochondria, and fearing no one would be able to save me if I was indeed having something.

As the years went by, I managed to get by just with a psychologist. I used to be proud of myself, and would proudly brag about how ""I turned my mind into a stronghold"", and ""nothing will break me"". Until I graduated, then 2016, and went to another town to work. My father disapproved of my decision, because he thought I'd be wasting my initial years of my career, and we had a huge falling out back then due to some very hurtful things he said about me and my mother (they divorced in 2010), and we haven't truly solved everything from back then. My panic attacks got worse, as I felt as if I was dying every time I had them. I was afraid because I couldn't get a hold of myself, and also I was struggling with paying my bills and everything else. Eventually things worked out in the end, I went back to therapy, as well as started going to a psychiatrist. For almost over a year I underwent treatment with Venlafaxine, and it had worked. I felt healthy, confident, and ready to face life again.

That is... until less than a month later, when I was fired from my job. Unjustly, I might add, but that's besides the point. I had to go back to the city where I finished college to find myself a new job. I had to have roommates again to be able to cover for my living expenses. One of these was a douchebag, who almost fucked us over as the rent contract was about to expire. Not only that, but I also had a long-ass commute, that ate three hours out of my day. All of this made me look for treatment again. I used to go to a psychiatrist, but I felt as if Venlafaxine wasn't having the same effect on my body anymore. I felt I became more apathetic, lost my appetite, my sex drive, among other collateral effects. I asked my doctor to try something else, and he kind of obliged, but he asked me to use another medication to which I also had bad reactions when I first started treatment back when I went to my first psychiatrist; I told him this story but he just shrugged it off. At that moment I realized that doctor didn't really care about me or my condition. I know I should have looked for someone else, but I thought I could just solve things on my own. 

For a while I thought I had got this. I thought that I was getting the hang of getting my psyche together, and that therapy was enough. It wasn't. As I was called to another project at my job, where I had to do something completely different from what I was used to doing, as well as having to deal with all sorts of people (most of them are unhelpful), my stress levels have only risen since the end of last year. I haven't taken any vacations, I haven't had the courage to ask to change to another project. And I've got no support system close to me. I have some guy friends I can vent to (usually my roommates), but that's the scope of this. I miss having my family close by, I miss having a SO (something I never really had in my life), I miss having someone I could ask for a hug and just be there in the moment for a while.

My anxieties have been piling up these past weeks, to the point where I don't know if the symptoms I'm having are just some viral infection or a psychosomatic response of all the stress I have been feeling. I feel as if I'm having more trouble recalling things, or articulating my ideas; sometimes my reaction times are weird, sometimes I have twitches and spasms.  Then there's the headaches... I went to the ER three times this past week. Tomography scans showed nothing weird on my head, blood tests came back with no problems at all. I sincerely don't know what to do anymore.

My parents say that it's okay if I need to take some time for myself -- yes, even my dad, who has apparently had a change of heart once he saw the things I went through these past years. I have things I want to do, but am afraid to take action. I know that if I just had the energy, if it wasn't all consumed by my working day, I might get more shit done. Instead, when I get back home, I don't want to see a lick of something that reminds me that ""I have to put effort on this"".

Let's fucking do this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's talk about pricing / discounts / refunds first. 

* THE PRICE IS THE PRICE. IF I SELL AN APPLE FOR $1 YOU DON'T ASK ME TO SELL IT TO YOU TO FOR HALF OF THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SOMEHOW MORE SPECIAL THAN THE OTHER 7 BILLION PEOPLE ON EARTH.
* NO. I will NOT give you a refund on your product just because you're ""having a hard time"" using the software. Fuck You. It's not my fucking fault you're using the software not as it was originally intended. 
* Don't come begging me for a refund after yelling at me for half an hour about how our establishment is shit and all of us are terrible at our jobs and our software / products / services are shit. Take your whiny ass to a different service. 
* Giving people discounts / refunds to stay as a customer only promotes bad behavior and doesn't let them understand the full scope of the problem. If people get into the mindset that all discounts / refunds can just be given to any fuckhead having a hard time then why don't we just sell the whole world for free, fuck it. who needs to pay to keep the lights on? just give everyone a refund because everyone is a whiny fuck who doesn't understand economics. 
* NO YOU DON'T DESERVE ANY DISCOUNT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN USING OUR PRODUCT FOR OVER 10 YEARS / SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON US. I appreciate the sentiment but that was YOUR decision, and for us to now somehow be responsible for your happiness or unhappines is bullshit. You are responsible for whether you like our products or not. Just because we come out with a software update that's not part of your liking, doesn't mean we should spend thousands of dollars in labor and resources reverting that update to our systems to suit your needs, your majesty. strutting around like you own the place, yelling at our customer service reps and demanding refunds left and right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate the entitlement people have thinking they somehow should qualify to not have to pay the price that millions of others pay just by sweet talking us or manipulating our sales reps.   


...

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the next portion of the rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

No, I can't ""just transfer you to someone who knows more"", there isn't a department for ""I'm shit so here's the actual good people"" that's not how call centers work. and NO, I can't just ""go get someone who knows more"". and NO YOU SHOULD NOT REQUEST TO SPEAK TO MY MANAGER JUST BECAUSE GOD FORBID I DON'T HAVE YOUR ANSWER IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also sick of when I give them a perfectly valid answer to their question in a short amount of time, email them extra resource links for them to do their own further reading on the subjects, and I'm extremely nice and empathetic to them as customers, AND then they have the audacity to ask to ""speak to someone who can get this taken care of"" when I clearly explain AND SHOW THEM that this isn't something that can just be ""taken care of"" just because I transfer you to someone else. NO you can't just speak to the actual developers of the fucking software, I'm pretty sure they're busy making a million dollars a year developing a multi-billion dollar software, they've got more important things to do then get yelled at all day by fuckwads, that's our job. Thanks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Stop yelling at customer service / tech support reps of a company about how the company is shit, do you think I sit in on board meetings and say ""hey you know what would be fantastic, Steve? If we just decided to get rid of a software feature that everyone loves in the next patch!"" just so you could yell at me about it for an hour straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also realize Customer Service people have their own lives outside of the job too, we've got shit going on, that person you're yelling at about how ""the company is shit"" doesn't have anything to do with WHY the company is shit, they're just part of the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

We may be ""representatives"" but we don't actually represent the company as a whole, we're really just like little ants, alone we are nothing but together we are the whole colony.

Around a year and a half ago I met this girl, I wasn't really all that into her at the start and I couldn't even put a face to her name at that point but from the start I always had a thing for her friend and when I didn't have a face to go with the name I liked to imagine it would be her friend. 4 days in (weekend happened so no college) I finally got to know who she was and I'm not being 100% honest if I say that I wasn't a little disappointed to see it wasn't her friend but never mind I was a desperate 17 year old at the time and I'd take almost any girl I could get.

   
 

We spoke most nights, not too much but enough to get to know each other and by the middle of the week we had become fairly friendly with each other to the point where we'd cuddle in college from time to time. 

   
 

After we finished the program that brought us together we had our first kiss and if I'm being honest I felt nothing from it. That should of been the first sign to leave it at that. I know what it's like to feel a spark between two people and there just wasn't one. She messaged be shortly after she left to say she thought it was a mistake that we kissed and we shouldn't of because she wants to stay friends. I didn't think much of it and just told her sure and left it as that. We still messaged from time to time and it all stayed the same really. I didn't feel anything from the kiss she didn't want anything from it. Job done right? Wrong. 

   
 

College went back to normal and everything was okay. My best friend started dating one her best friend (this will come into play shortly) He slowly started spending more time with her and that friendship group and less time with me so I felt a bit abandoned but it didn't phase me much. That same week. The girl I had kissed not even 4 days ago. The same girl who said I've just got out of a relationship and dont want anything til at least new year (it was early December) got with him

e scummiest and trashiest guy you could of ever seen. It was that point where my feelings that I thought were no existent came in. It wasn't that strong but I definitely felt somenthing in terms of jealousy. Still i carried on with my life.

2 weeks later she broke up with him right before the Christmas holiday because of her boyfriends family issues and she seemed heart broken. They had only been dating for 2 weeks and known each other for like 3. She immediately came back to me. That should if been the second sign somenthing was wrong.

   
 

Me being me I invited my friend, his girlfriend and now single friend over for a movie day. In my mind I knew the day was going to end with us kissing and I was right for the most part. It escalated very quickly and went from laying in a sofa watching a movie to her making me feel her up to her leading me upstairs where we kissed, felt each other up and ultimately started foreplay with each other (playing with genitals.) It was a nice day and it felt like things were finally changing for me being a person who normally gets screwed over with these sorts of things. But one thing ill remember from that day is that at one point I said ""dont get back with your ex again"" and she said ""I like doing this, even if I did get back with him we can still do this he lives in the next town over so he'd never know"" She genuinely just told me she'd cheat on her boyfriend.

   
 

The following day in the morning I got a message from my best friend asking if I was up to anything. Me never having any plans said no and immediately I was told to come out and meet him, his girlfriend and of course her. (For simplicity's sake I'm going to call the main girl G1) It seemed a bit odd that all of a sudden G1 wanted me to come out and meet them because the messages between us at that point didn't have the same feeling to them. They didn't really feel like anything but I went along with it and agreed to meet them all. They were all already there when I got there but we all just sat around and talked for a bit before heading off to town to get food.

   
 

Nothing special really happened between now and getting food but after I was told we were going to a small park to sit down. The park overlooked the train station and it was a nice place to sit. When we got there 3 of us sat down and G1 decided to sit on my lap. I didn't think anything of it and wasn't bothered by it until the following conversation ensued. My friends gf asked G1 what time Ryan was getting here. I didn't know who Ryan was but G1 responded that it should be soon. (Ryan wasn't her recent ex btw.) Confused as ever I whispered in her ear ""whos Ryan?"" She responded with ""one of my exes."" Now I started to get a bit sketched out as I sat there and wondered what was going on. A few moments passed and I asked ""why are you talking about Ryan"" to find out G1 was planning on meeting him. Me thinking I had been screwed over yet again by another girl and being the pushover I am asked ""Do you want me to stay when he gets here"" and thinking I had been asked to meet her becuase she started to like me the next words I heard genuinely crushed me. She simply responded ""Probably not"" In that moment I knew I had been screwed over. There was no doubt in my mind that G1 had used me so she wouldn't be alone til her ex arrived. 

   
 

Funnily enough he never did show up and she was so upset by that I could tell she still really liked him. That what another blow to my confidence. Through out all of this she was sat on my lap texting him right in front of me. I wanted to get up and leave right there and then. From there the day went a bit smoother. I didn't speak to her much til we got back to the main park we started the day at and we spoke a bit then kissed a little and we felt each other up a bit similar to the day before but that was it. The worst conversation we had that day was when I asked her about her recent ex. She said she wasn't getting back together with him at all and that to me was a good sign so I asked her ""if I was to ask you out, I'm not saying I am but if I did would you say yes?"" No, she straight up said no. That should of been the third sign not to bother with her. She then belittled me for the rest of the time I was there talking about her recent ex was better than me telling all this to my face when we were alone. I just brushed it off and didn't think anything of it.

   
 

The following week leading up to Christmas wasn't anything special. We spoke daily and nothing had changed in her attitude to talking to me. Then came Christmas, the Christmas that I will never forget as long as I live. It was a regular Christmas to start with, we messaged each other to wish a happy Christmas. Later that night after everything was calming down the messages became a bit more serious. I dont know what it was or what had happened but out of nowhere she said she loved me. This one moment threw me off for the rest of my life. This was the moment my feelings for her developed past a point of no return. I no longer had the choice of ""leaving it as it was"" anymore. 

   
 

Following Christmas we didn't see each other becuase she was ""busy"" and we never really mentioned what happened on Christmas. Before the holidays were over I tried getting closer to her at one point suggesting id go and sit with her and talk to her in college. She said no becuase her ex would be there and didn't want us together. I didn't see how that was an issue but I just shrugged it off.

   
 

New year came around and G1 and her recent ex still were apart. When we went back to college thats when stuff started to go wrong. The first day back nothing eventful happened, she came and spoke to me at break to check if I was okay and that was it. Not even a week later after coming out of my last lesson I saw G1 walking her ex to his bus holding hands. I lost my shit there and then. She had been telling me for the past 3 weeks that they weren't getting back together and now this. I messaged her as soon as I got home to ask what the fuck was happening and apparently he had asked her out again and she said yes. The reason she didn't wasn't me sitting with them was becuase she was still talking to him and secretly wanted to get back together. Her best friend found out (the one dating my best friend who came to the park and movie day) and she told me she knew becuase she has a history and reputation for talking to multiple guys at once and fucking around with different people. Turns out that all through December she was talking to me, Ryan her old ex and her recent ex (now bf.)

   
 

That day there and then I removed her off everything and blocked her on snapchat. Weirdly enough once I did that everything seemed better. I seemed happier, things were more enjoyable. It was like this massive weight had been lifted off my shoulder.

   
 

The next 5 months dont really matter as nothing of importance happened between us but things were definitely feeling easier for me. Around mid May I was on a night out with some friends I hadn't seen in years and at one point one of them mentioned G1's boyfriends name. My ears pricked up the moment I heard that name. I hated hearing his name so much and still do to this day. I asked her what was going on and she said he was hitting on her. She had all the snapchats and text's saved from him and showed the group them. It was clear he was being dishonest to G1. I got my friend to send me them becuase although I wasn't talking to G1 anymore my best friend was. I knew she had me blocked too so even if I wanted to tell her I couldn't and I didn't have an issue with that. 

   
 

On the last day of college before the half term my friend told her. I dont know what happened over the phone when he told her but 5 minutes later I get a friend request off her asking for the photos of the messages. The relationship ended that day. 

   
 

I did my best to comfort her and help her through it and one day she came over and we just spoke about it, nothing else really happened after that apart from she said she loved me again. This time to my face not over text. I didn't say it back becuase I knew she was just in a bad place and she probably didn't mean it. (she didn't)

   
 

When the holiday was over everything went back to normal. The First day back they were back together. Of all things you dont do getting back with someone who cheated on you is at the top of that list. Towards the end of May I was accepted onto an overseas volunteering program and I was completely overjoyed. I had started all the immunisations and health and safety training etc. One weekend when I was in Manchester staying overnight for a training weekend she messaged me wanting to talk. It turns out that her boyfriend had cheated on her yet again behind her back. With one of her best friends as well. It was the worst weekend for it to happen becuase it was the one time I wasn't home and couldn't message her properly. 

   
 

I spend that night and the next day talking to her about it all and trying to make her feel better. Id message her every time I got a chance to during the training and we'd just talk about stuff. On the way home we were still talking and surprise surprise she said she loved me again. (You can start to see a trend here) We side stepped around it and just left it at that.

   
 

We didn't talk much and they stayed together all til summer when they finally broke up for good. She wanted space now and wanted to be single. There was nothing I could/wanted to do at this point. We gradually spoke more and more to the point where we got a lot closer, started using pet names for each other (Boo), sending nudes to one another and even got to the point where we both said we'd try a relationship together but not at the moment becuase I was leaving in 2 months and she wanted to be single for a while. 

   
 

She came over 1 more time before I left and becuase we had gotten a lot close more happened than normal. It started as the normal talking, hugging, moved onto kissing fairly quickly and from there it went from 0 to 100 really quick. Before I even knew what happened we were both naked in bed playing with each other and doing oral. She's had this tendency to leave the minute we get to anything like this with some stupid excuse. I dont think she felt uncomfortable I just dont think she could be bothered. Either way that was the last time I saw her before I left the country.

   
 

Before I left for 3 months we had a proper chat about what we both wanted and what we were going to do when I got back. We both ended up deciding that we would try a relationship after Christmas. (I left in October and got back in December) That right there. The hope of finally having a relationship with this girl I had liked for a year now and never had the chance to do anything about it was finally happening. There was a rocky patch where she made some guy up to ""test if id still want her"" it was super weird and hurt me a lot but I still dont fully understand why she did it. Still the false hope of a relationship kept me hopeful and happy. This was the only thing keeping me taking to her. It may sound bad but by this point it was all or nothing for me. I dont want a friendship with this girl. It was a relationship or nothing simply because I didn't want all of these feelings laying around.

   
 

The time had come, I was finally coming home. We were both happy about it as we'd finally get to see each other and id get to finally confront her about all these feelings. Did I see her the day I got back... No. The day after? No She was ""too busy"" to come and see me. That was the moment I knew id been played for the past year. It was the moment I knew what type of person she was and that she would carry on doing it until she found a new boyfriend. I was the temporary graft...

   
 

In the new year when we said we'd try a relationship things went to complete shit between us. She didn't give any fucks anymore and to make things worse I lost my grandad on the 2nd. Didn't tell anyone and stopped talking to her on the 4th. I had no one to talk to. No one to help and the only person I had close to me in my life didn't want anything to do with me anymore. A week or two passed and she popped up. She was claiming how badly she had fucked up and that she couldn't stop thinking about me and what we had. Stupidly I let her talk to me and we started talking again.

   
 

Later in February a whole 2 MONTHS after I had got back we finally met up. She claimed she had been ""So busy"" with no spare time to meet people. Which was a downright lie but I met her. Not a lot happened. we watched a movie and kissed becuase I had told her prior we weren't doing anything anymore. The thing that made me so pissed about that day wasn't that we didn't do anything more or wasn't that we didn't talk about the relationship, it was the fact that I hadn't seen this girl for 6 months and within the first 30 mins of being here she was called by work and volunteered to go in and work meaning she would have to leave in an hour and a half. 6 MONTHS and all I get is 2 hours.

   
 

I had had enough, I grew a pair of balls and told her exactly what was happening, how there would be no more talking, no more fucking around and no more us. The weight had once again been lifted. I was so happy but so upset at the same time. I had spent all this time, had all these feelings and gotten absolutely nothing out of it. I had wasted a year and a half of my life on this girl.

   
 

She's one of those people who will always have a place in my heart and ill always want to be with her but at the same time she's such a bad person that I cant let myself do it becuase I know that unless she changed I couldn't be with her becuase it would all happen again. I know how she acted with both of her ex's. I know how she acts when she genuinely likes someone and based on that I can tell you she didn't with me. 

   
 

I was the filler...

   
 

I dont speak to her anymore and I dont know if I ever will and I know nothing will probably happen between us ever again but after everything. After all the struggling I went through with her I still had regrets.

   
 

The biggest one wasn't that she never let us try a relationship.

   
 

It wasn't that I didn't stop things when I should of.

   
 

My biggest regret was that we never had a proper last kiss.

   
 

But anyway she's happy now, she's speaking to someone new and probably cares about him enough to treat him like a person so good luck Sara.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a year and a half ago I met this girl, I wasn&amp;#39;t really all that into her at the start and I couldn&amp;#39;t even put a face to her name at that point but from the start I always had a thing for her friend and when I didn&amp;#39;t have a face to go with the name I liked to imagine it would be her friend. 4 days in (weekend happened so no college) I finally got to know who she was and I&amp;#39;m not being 100% honest if I say that I wasn&amp;#39;t a little disappointed to see it wasn&amp;#39;t her friend but never mind I was a desperate 17 year old at the time and I&amp;#39;d take almost any girl I could get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke most nights, not too much but enough to get to know each other and by the middle of the week we had become fairly friendly with each other to the point where we&amp;#39;d cuddle in college from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we finished the program that brought us together we had our first kiss and if I&amp;#39;m being honest I felt nothing from it. That should of been the first sign to leave it at that. I know what it&amp;#39;s like to feel a spark between two people and there just wasn&amp;#39;t one. She messaged be shortly after she left to say she thought it was a mistake that we kissed and we shouldn&amp;#39;t of because she wants to stay friends. I didn&amp;#39;t think much of it and just told her sure and left it as that. We still messaged from time to time and it all stayed the same really. I didn&amp;#39;t feel anything from the kiss she didn&amp;#39;t want anything from it. Job done right? Wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College went back to normal and everything was okay. My best friend started dating one her best friend (this will come into play shortly) He slowly started spending more time with her and that friendship group and less time with me so I felt a bit abandoned but it didn&amp;#39;t phase me much. That same week. The girl I had kissed not even 4 days ago. The same girl who said I&amp;#39;ve just got out of a relationship and dont want anything til at least new year (it was early December) got with him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e scummiest and trashiest guy you could of ever seen. It was that point where my feelings that I thought were no existent came in. It wasn&amp;#39;t that strong but I definitely felt somenthing in terms of jealousy. Still i carried on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks later she broke up with him right before the Christmas holiday because of her boyfriends family issues and she seemed heart broken. They had only been dating for 2 weeks and known each other for like 3. She immediately came back to me. That should if been the second sign somenthing was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me being me I invited my friend, his girlfriend and now single friend over for a movie day. In my mind I knew the day was going to end with us kissing and I was right for the most part. It escalated very quickly and went from laying in a sofa watching a movie to her making me feel her up to her leading me upstairs where we kissed, felt each other up and ultimately started foreplay with each other (playing with genitals.) It was a nice day and it felt like things were finally changing for me being a person who normally gets screwed over with these sorts of things. But one thing ill remember from that day is that at one point I said &amp;quot;dont get back with your ex again&amp;quot; and she said &amp;quot;I like doing this, even if I did get back with him we can still do this he lives in the next town over so he&amp;#39;d never know&amp;quot; She genuinely just told me she&amp;#39;d cheat on her boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day in the morning I got a message from my best friend asking if I was up to anything. Me never having any plans said no and immediately I was told to come out and meet him, his girlfriend and of course her. (For simplicity&amp;#39;s sake I&amp;#39;m going to call the main girl G1) It seemed a bit odd that all of a sudden G1 wanted me to come out and meet them because the messages between us at that point didn&amp;#39;t have the same feeling to them. They didn&amp;#39;t really feel like anything but I went along with it and agreed to meet them all. They were all already there when I got there but we all just sat around and talked for a bit before heading off to town to get food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing special really happened between now and getting food but after I was told we were going to a small park to sit down. The park overlooked the train station and it was a nice place to sit. When we got there 3 of us sat down and G1 decided to sit on my lap. I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it and wasn&amp;#39;t bothered by it until the following conversation ensued. My friends gf asked G1 what time Ryan was getting here. I didn&amp;#39;t know who Ryan was but G1 responded that it should be soon. (Ryan wasn&amp;#39;t her recent ex btw.) Confused as ever I whispered in her ear &amp;quot;whos Ryan?&amp;quot; She responded with &amp;quot;one of my exes.&amp;quot; Now I started to get a bit sketched out as I sat there and wondered what was going on. A few moments passed and I asked &amp;quot;why are you talking about Ryan&amp;quot; to find out G1 was planning on meeting him. Me thinking I had been screwed over yet again by another girl and being the pushover I am asked &amp;quot;Do you want me to stay when he gets here&amp;quot; and thinking I had been asked to meet her becuase she started to like me the next words I heard genuinely crushed me. She simply responded &amp;quot;Probably not&amp;quot; In that moment I knew I had been screwed over. There was no doubt in my mind that G1 had used me so she wouldn&amp;#39;t be alone til her ex arrived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough he never did show up and she was so upset by that I could tell she still really liked him. That what another blow to my confidence. Through out all of this she was sat on my lap texting him right in front of me. I wanted to get up and leave right there and then. From there the day went a bit smoother.

The worst conversation we had that day was when I asked her about her recent ex. She said she wasn&amp;#39;t getting back together with him at all and that to me was a good sign so I asked her &amp;quot;if I was to ask you out, I&amp;#39;m not saying I am but if I did would you say yes?&amp;quot; No, she straight up said no. That should of been the third sign not to bother with her. She then belittled me for the rest of the time I was there talking about her recent ex was better than me telling all this to my face when we were alone. I just brushed it off and didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it.&lt;/p&gt;

And the thing is, if I didn't have to work closing shift I wouldn't mind it nearly as much.  It's a lovely, low key job (with good pay) until about 6 when I have to start cleaning up.

It's a cafe job inside another business and I close alone. I have to clean up in between customers, and sometimes people order huge several course meals that I have to go deliver to their office and then clean up after. I go home at 8, but sometimes 2 hours isn't enough to close if its busy. And if I start closing ahead of time (I've tried many times) it won't make a difference because customers will just mean messing everything up again.

The manager also thinks that I need to stay after my shift ""until everything is done."" In other words, I can't leave until every single thing on the checklist is done, I have to stay after my shift is over if it's not done and 8 is already late for me and I'm already exhausted. Also people come up and order meals at 7:59 and I have to take their orders even if it takes 10 minutes to cook like a pizza.

I know this sounds like a lot of whining and maybe it is, but I've always hated closing in general.

I have extreme ADHD but nothing scares him about my crack-addicted personality (I am sober, but I am insane). 

We usually completely bang at this point, but it hasn’t happened quite yet. He is sitting right next to me and I really miss him a lot. I wore him out today.

My country is still pretty undeveloped and full of backwards communisitc mindsets.
My relationship with him is pretty bad because he portrays himself as an alpha male,while I am a “pussy boy”.
He always called me less than a boy because I wasn’t the guy always doing well with girls,always introverted because of a terrible self esteem and being skinny didn’t help.
I think he wanted me to become an alpha male,player,popular,take over his businesses,go to a great foreign college,speaking tons of foreign languages and having a bodybuilder phisique.
But I turned out to be skinny(I try to workout and build muscles,but i really hate public gyms),failed almost all my exams multiple times,have just two friends,never had a grilfriend(I am 22 years old),
I always feel that i am the biggest loser in this town that i started to hate.
The girl that I like will never like a loser like me and that hurts me.
At one point  I got into a terrible depression after being bullied by both my father and collegs for almost my whole life.
My father used to beat me for no reason  until I couldn’t get up.
He even broke my head once.
He told me things like:”You’re nothing like me”, “Where whould I have been if i behaved like you”, “You behave like a girl”, “You should have been born a girl”.
I started to develop severe anxiety when I saw him,I still do toaday.
I got into therapy paid by him for 3 years and I still didn’t solve all my problems completely.
I got into therapy with severe anxiety,depression,suicidal,anorexic and with thoughts that i was transgender. 
I started to believe I was transgender after seeing that my father and other people don’t see me as a real men because I wasn’t an alpha player with 100% confidence.
Everyone thought i was a freak because of my terrible depression and social anxiety.
I heard about trans people and studied the subject until I started to become certain that I was transgender.
My family started to notice that I started to not eat for a whole week and  was always crying so i told them what i believe.
They were horrified when I told them and my father got very emotional and started to cry every night about it.
He even contemplated suicide about it,which I am terribly sorry that he went through it.
My mother was angry because she thought I spoke nonsense and that I hurt my father with my stupid thoughts.
What makes me more angry is that my family members thought more about what people will think about them than my situation.
We live in a very religious undeveloped country in Eastern Europe were people are totally against LGBT rights and many people would either make fun of you or totally ignore you.
I talked to him after a couple years of therapy and he wasn’t sorry about everything he did and say.
He thought the beatings were because I deserved them(no reason given)and the ridicule was to motivate me.
In the ended I concluded I wasn’t transgender and it was just my depression and poor self image and I regret saying i wanted to change my  gender and become a girl. 
I spend most of my time alone and he is still very upset about this because I still live with him.
My tendency is to run from social situations and  cry afterwars beceause I couldn’t do it.
I am afraid that my efforts in school won’t matther because of my past,that I will never have a circle friends,no girlfriend,no job,no driver license.
I always feel that I am wasting my time doing anything and achieving stuff because in the end everyone will run away from me after they hear my dark secret.
I got a victim mentality becasue of things that my father did to me.
My wish is to stop resenting him and to start creating a great life for myself. 
I don’t think that aquintances, relatives, friends or people in college will ever talk to me after finding about me saying that i thought i was transgender and contemplated about gender reassignment.
People in this city are not open minded and I am afraid they will ridicule me till I give up. 
I am terrified of complete loneliness forever.
Many people would never associate with if they heard about my episode and many doors wold be closed for me.
I am always paranoid about people that I meet.
I ask myself questions like:What if they know somebody that knows this secret about?
Why should I try to know them if they will leave me once they hear this secret.
Everyone will think less about me.
I even regret telling this to my therapist because I feel terrible fear when I meet her in public. 
My lists of concerns is:having a conflict or accident with someone that knows me and that person destroys my life by telling everybody my secret or being called transgender in public by soemone.
I am even afraid  to go into the neighbourhood where my therapist lives and I even made a terrible mistake to go to therapy in place that I regulary go to(same block as the one she works in).
I know she is legally required to not share anything but I am still afraid of her
Her son goes to college in the same city I go to and I am afraid that if i make more friends I might bump into him one day.
Networking  is very important but I am afraid to do it because of my constant paranoia to be called transgender.
I want to become a well known businessman with lots of friends and girlfriend but my fear is kepping me low because i feel the need to hide.
Sometimes I think to leave my city and country and to start all over without ever talking to my family or former friends but I think my fears of bumping into someone who knows  my secret  will not get away.
I fear that if I ever have kids this will go on them to and people will ridicule them because dad wanted once to become a transgender.

Everyone will think less about me.
I even regret telling this to my therapist because I feel terrible fear when I meet her in public. 
My lists of concerns is:having a conflict or accident with someone that knows me and that person destroys my life by telling everybody my secret or being called transgender in public by soemone.
I am even afraid  to go into the neighbourhood where my therapist lives and I even made a terrible mistake to go to therapy in place that I regulary go to(same block as the one she works in).
I know she is legally required to not share anything but I am still afraid of her
Her son goes to college in the same city I go to and I am afraid that if i make more friends I might bump into him one day.
Networking  is very important but I am afraid to do it because of my constant paranoia to be called transgender.
I want to become a well known businessman with lots of friends and girlfriend but my fear is kepping me low because i feel the need to hide.
Sometimes I think to leave my city and country and to start all over without ever talking to my family or former friends but I think my fears of bumping into someone who knows  my secret  will not get away.
I fear that if I ever have kids this will go on them to and people will ridicule them because dad wanted once to become a transgender. 
Becoming a social recluse is a terrible fear of mine and I don’t want my life to destroyed because of my fathers actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Story: So it first started when we got into an argument that she technically started. She told me she was pregnant and scared. I said that if she really doesn't want the baby then to get an abortion.

I sat at home crying the rest of the day because I realized that they were really only my friends because I was friends with FB. we also got into an argument because she said she won her dance competition and all I said was ""cool"".

This is a grade 12 high school course. I'd finished my work and was just sitting there waiting to leave or something and my teacher speaks up to the remaining kids (who haven't already run their way out early). Now my teacher is a really good teacher, like my favourite. She's the kinda person who has a fire for her profession, complete passion for what she's teaching, fake or real it gets us all to get 80s. But, that day she said, ""Who here wants to smoke tomorrow."" I thought she was joking, like some sort of her humour or something. WEe all laughed but she repeated.   ""I have the cigarettes I need two people."" For the record, I have VERY strong personal beliefs on things, and I refuse to do something I disagree with or be part of it at all. One thing I have personal issues with is smoking and drugs. I had my friend clarify what was going on because I had my headphone in, just in case I heard it wrong.  

&amp;#x200B;

  ""Ms.\_\_\_\_ is getting two kids to volunteer to smoke tomorrow."" He was laughing. I looked up at her, ""I feel like that's illegal?"" With a small chuckle. ""Nope! I have full permission."" She said back with this s\*it eating grin. I turn to my friend who's having a hell of a time and I'm like ""That's fucked up."" He laughed again. ""It's not funny this is actually fucked up.""    ""I know! That's why it's funny."" I didn't think it was funny. This made me sick. Absolutely pissed off, this wasn't right. My vice principal and principal have EXPELLED kids for even smelling like smoke or weed, so how the fuck was she getting paid to make two kids chain smoke two cigarettes, and make them throw up?   but what pissed me off was she stood up there and said: ""I draw the line at weed and alcohol."" And as she passed my desk I said to her. ""This is pretty much the worst thing you could make one of us take in."" And she looked at me, pointed and said ""bull!"" That really pissed me off. So I stayed until the end of class and walked up to her desk.

&amp;#x200B;

   ""I'm not coming in tomorrow, is there any way I can get off an absence with some sort of moral ground or something?""

  ""What? Really?"" 

""Yeah."" 

""Huh. Why?"" 

""I just think that shit that you're going to do is messed up and I don't want to see it, smell it, support it or even be near it."" I did swear, but quieter than my normal voice.  

""Well, I'm doing this to show you that smoking messes with your heart."" 

""I think we all trust you on that point, Ms.\_\_\_. Isn't there something else you could do? If nothing else, let's watch a video on it or something."" I can't remember what she said but I think it was some bullshit about ""Seeing it first hand."" B\*TCH I FUCKING HAVE. WE ALL HAVE.    

&amp;#x200B;

 I got too pissed and she showed me what page we were doing, but I wasn't paying attention. Finally, she said she would have to give me an absence and I said. ""Alright, I'll take it. Bye."" And I left the room with my stuff. I was pissed about it, yeah, but what bothered me more is that NO ONE else seemed bothered! Why was I the only one? I don't agree with any drugs, but cigarettes hit a fucking cord with me.  

&amp;#x200B;

  The next day I went to the office. I'm friends with the lady at the desk even though I don't know her name. She's given me free 'presents' before. I asked, ""Hey, I'm not going to the next class, is there any way I could get the absence repealed or something. I don't agree with what they're doing and I don't want to be a part of it."" But I have one report against this teacher for accidentally burning myself and I didn't want another. I just wanted this to go over smoothly and without paperwork haha. I'm not afraid to stand up for how I think or feel, but I was a p\*ssy that day, no one else was angry about it but me so I didn't feel like I had the like... Clout or whatever to do anything about it alone.    

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short: It became a thing and the lady was worried but I didn't tell her what was going on, because I didn't want shit. I ended up just saying ""I'll take the absence."" And left, sitting int he cafeteria and worked. another more important person came to me and asked what was up I told her I didn't support Ms.\_\_\_\_\_'s actions today and I wasn't taking part in them.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh. Why?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just think that shit that you&amp;#39;re going to do is messed up and I don&amp;#39;t want to see it, smell it, support it or even be near it.&amp;quot; I did swear, but quieter than my normal voice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I&amp;#39;m doing this to show you that smoking messes with your heart.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think we all trust you on that point, Ms.___. Isn&amp;#39;t there something else you could do? If nothing else, let&amp;#39;s watch a video on it or something.&amp;quot; I can&amp;#39;t remember what she said but I think it was some bullshit about &amp;quot;Seeing it first hand.&amp;quot; B*TCH I FUCKING HAVE. WE ALL HAVE.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got too pissed and she showed me what page we were doing, but I wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention. Finally, she said she would have to give me an absence and I said. &amp;quot;Alright, I&amp;#39;ll take it. Bye.&amp;quot; And I left the room with my stuff. I was pissed about it, yeah, but what bothered me more is that NO ONE else seemed bothered! Why was I the only one? I don&amp;#39;t agree with any drugs, but cigarettes hit a fucking cord with me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I went to the office. I&amp;#39;m friends with the lady at the desk even though I don&amp;#39;t know her name. She&amp;#39;s given me free &amp;#39;presents&amp;#39; before. I asked, &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;m not going to the next class, is there any way I could get the absence repealed or something. I don&amp;#39;t agree with what they&amp;#39;re doing and I don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of it.&amp;quot; But I have one report against this teacher for accidentally burning myself and I didn&amp;#39;t want another. I just wanted this to go over smoothly and without paperwork haha. I&amp;#39;m not afraid to stand up for how I think or feel, but I was a p*ssy that day, no one else was angry about it but me so I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I had the like... Clout or whatever to do anything about it alone.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: It became a thing and the lady was worried but I didn&amp;#39;t tell her what was going on, because I didn&amp;#39;t want shit. I ended up just saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll take the absence.&amp;quot; And left, sitting int he cafeteria and worked. another more important person came to me and asked what was up I told her I didn&amp;#39;t support Ms._____&amp;#39;s actions today and I wasn&amp;#39;t taking part in them. Good thing my school is laid back because she decided just to leave me alone.&lt;/p&gt;

I have this friend, let's call her Q. And my recent ex-best friend, he will be, M.

M and I were really great friends throughout high school and most of my freshman year of college, but I stopped being friends with him because he is absurdly petty and prideful. A lot of the drama that happened my first year of college, I blame on him and his unwillingness to apologize whenever he is wrong.

For example, the first major fight we had was because he decided to write a long paragraph about not caring if we were friends or not (implying our 3+ year friendship was meaningless), because I ignored him for one day for pissing me off and he basically made the situation worse, on something that did not need his opinion whatsoever. If he would have let me be mad in peace, I would have gotten over it by the next day. This turned into a huge fiasco which made me depressed to point where I couldn't get out of bed and just made me hate my life. After some coaxing and talking with mutual friends, he realized how badly he fucked up and apologized with the help of a friend. More like that friend apologized on his behalf as he didn't say anything to me directly and had every question I asked answered by that friend, which was infuriating because this was a problem between M and me, not this other person. This was the first instance.

The last time we fought was the final straw. He accused me of saying something behind his back and implying that he was an attention-seeking whore when there were people there as witnesses telling him I never said anything along those lines. I tried to talk to him but he would not listen to me and refused to apologize for being in the wrong, he never acknowledged me. I had enough of his bullshit and made the decision to leave him alone and see if he would ever reach out to me. I gave him two-three weeks as a deadline to reach out to me and apologize. He didn't know I did this, but I was tired of being the one to fight for this friendship when I never did anything wrong, having to reach out to him in order to hang out. He found out about this deadline and decided that I was causing too much drama and I was being unreasonable. We stopped being friends.

Back to what I originally wanted opinions on.

Now my friend Q is madly into M, to the point of it being borderline obsessive. I don't mind that she wants to be with him because I can't control who other people want to associate with. M knows Q likes him. He uses it to his advantage. He has no intention of ever dating her and uses her. He uses her for help on homework, which turns into her doing it for him, and basically being his bitch; anything he wants her to do, she will. She literally plans her whole fucking day around his schedule. Anytime she can, she will spend it with him. It is SO INFURIATING!! Besides that fact that she is his bitch at this point, she literally has no time for anyone else. Multiple times she canceled plans that we planned beforehand or will leave in the middle of them, because she has ""homework to work on."" But if you look at her snapchat she is spending that time with M. Multiple people have told her that this relationship between them is toxic, but she doesn't care because she is ""happy"" around him.

Q's birthday is coming up soon and she wants all of her friends to come celebrate it, including M and I. But I and a couple of friends really don't want to go because of how much she prioritizes M over her other friends. But at the same time, we feel extremely guilty because she's never really had friends before us. We don't know what to do. We want to be there for her but we most likely won't go because of how many times she chose M over us and at this point we're just tired of it. Some examples of this are skipping friends' birthdays because of M, completely leaving without telling anyone about her whereabouts to go with M, and just overall being a shitty friend. Now, this would be a completely different story if Q and M were dating, but he has made it clear multiple times that he is not interested in Q at all. He told me this before we stopped being friends, has told his roommates, and mutual friends.

Is it wrong to miss her birthday? We will, of course, tell her the reason why we won't be going and explain how we've been feeling about this whole situation, just tired of all of this bullshit. The friends that are not going, I included, instead plan on hanging out and doing our own thing.

Should I stop being friends with her? Please help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; story, bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this friend, let&amp;#39;s call her Q. And my recent ex-best friend, he will be, M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M and I were really great friends throughout high school and most of my freshman year of college, but I stopped being friends with him because he is absurdly petty and prideful. A lot of the drama that happened my first year of college, I blame on him and his unwillingness to apologize whenever he is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the first major fight we had was because he decided to write a long paragraph about not caring if we were friends or not (implying our 3+ year friendship was meaningless), because I ignored him for one day for pissing me off and he basically made the situation worse, on something that did not need his opinion whatsoever. If he would have let me be mad in peace, I would have gotten over it by the next day. This turned into a huge fiasco which made me depressed to point where I couldn&amp;#39;t get out of bed and just made me hate my life. After some coaxing and talking with mutual friends, he realized how badly he fucked up and apologized with the help of a friend. More like that friend apologized on his behalf as he didn&amp;#39;t say anything to me directly and had every question I asked answered by that friend, which was infuriating because this was a problem between M and me, not this other person. This was the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we fought was the final straw. He accused me of saying something behind his back and implying that he was an attention-seeking whore when there were people there as witnesses telling him I never said anything along those lines. I tried to talk to him but he would not listen to me and refused to apologize for being in the wrong, he never acknowledged me. I had enough of his bullshit and made the decision to leave him alone and see if he would ever reach out to me. I gave him two-three weeks as a deadline to reach out to me and apologize. He didn&amp;#39;t know I did this, but I was tired of being the one to fight for this friendship when I never did anything wrong, having to reach out to him in order to hang out. He found out about this deadline and decided that I was causing too much drama and I was being unreasonable. We stopped being friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to what I originally wanted opinions on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my friend Q is madly into M, to the point of it being borderline obsessive. I don&amp;#39;t mind that she wants to be with him because I can&amp;#39;t control who other people want to associate with. M knows Q likes him. He uses it to his advantage. He has no intention of ever dating her and uses her. He uses her for help on homework, which turns into her doing it for him, and basically being his bitch; anything he wants her to do, she will. She literally plans her whole fucking day around his schedule. Anytime she can, she will spend it with him. It is SO INFURIATING!! Besides that fact that she is his bitch at this point, she literally has no time for anyone else. Multiple times she canceled plans that we planned beforehand or will leave in the middle of them, because she has &amp;quot;homework to work on.&amp;quot; But if you look at her snapchat she is spending that time with M. Multiple people have told her that this relationship between them is toxic, but she doesn&amp;#39;t care because she is &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;#39;s birthday is coming up soon and she wants all of her friends to come celebrate it, including M and I. But I and a couple of friends really don&amp;#39;t want to go because of how much she prioritizes M over her other friends. But at the same time, we feel extremely guilty because she&amp;#39;s never really had friends before us. We don&amp;#39;t know what to do. We want to be there for her but we most likely won&amp;#39;t go because of how many times she chose M over us and at this point we&amp;#39;re just tired of it. Some examples of this are skipping friends&amp;#39; birthdays because of M, completely leaving without telling anyone about her whereabouts to go with M, and just overall being a shitty friend. Now, this would be a completely different story if Q and M were dating, but he has made it clear multiple times that he is not interested in Q at all.

I [38F]am happily in a relationship with my [45M] boyfriend and have been for quite some time. My bf and I live apart and see each other on the weekends. 
Last weekend, my neighbor, made friendly conversation as he [50M] usually does. He asks how my sister is (he's seen my sister at a local store she works at) and how my mom is (she lives in the same complex).
We chat about the crazy stuff going on around the building and about my niece's and his granddaughter, which are around the same age-4.
When we finished our conversation, he wanted to shake my hand. He usually does. Sometimes I think he wants a hug but we're not even on that level of friendship. He puts out his hand so we can shake hands and part ways, and he HOLDS ON! He keeps his grip to caress my hand. I quickly let go, weirded out and say my goodbyes. It really made me uncomfortable. It was too long and too weird for a handshake, like we've done since I met him. It bothered me and I mentioned it to my bf. He laughed and said it's nothing. My bf also happened to be at my apartment the NEXT DAY and he and I were chatting outside, enjoying the weather. The neighbor comes home and walks by, gives me a GLARE and ignores me when I say hello as he walks by. Since then, he's gone out of his way to walk around his building to not run into me. He literally parks right next to my apartment and walks the entire length of his building(around the back) to get to the front, where he won't have to walk by my apartment. I'm not a mean spirited person, I didn't mean to lead him on or make him feel as if I were available and interested. I also don't like making anyone feel bad but I feel as if I've done so unintentionally. He's avoiding me at all costs now but I didn't mean to hurt his feelings if that's what I've done. Then again, our friendship was very basic. We didn't hang out, we would just have small talk anytime we'd see each other. I'm just venting because I don't like being the cause of hurt or angry feelings.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in a small apartment complex that I like to refer to as the crazy vortex.

&amp;#x200B;

Today at work was also weird - people started treating me as if I were the supervisor. I want to view it as a good thing, because it means people seem to see potential in me or respect my abilities at work, but at the same time, it feels like a lot of pressure to be amazing at work when I've not even been at the job for a year yet. I was just the guy that got thrown in at the deep end when I started out of necessity to the job - I've had to learn fast and develop quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

My housemates are also a fucking nightmare - one of them doesn't clean up around the house and constantly plays video games or watches YouTube at a supersonic volume late at night - I don't care how Fernandinio or whoever the fuck is a ""fucking useless twat"" because he didn't score a goal and got red carded for a foul in a fictional football match. Another one of them is so high and mighty with their head up their own arse so far, I wonder if he can brush his teeth with his hair. And then the third one, I have to work with, so I never get a break from her, or her moaning about housemate number 2, whom she is dating. I'm also pretty sure one of them is stealing my bath stuff - my toothbrushes, toothpaste and nail/hair clippers keep going missing, and I know where I put them back.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there's the cats - dear god, those little shits. I was never keen on cats before moving into this house, but now I'm even more certain that I don't like cats. ""Oh, I see you've had a rough day...LOOK AT MY GLORIOUS ASSHOLE!"", ""MEOW! THERE'S NO FOOD IN MY BOWL DESPITE THE FACT YOU LITERALLY JUST POURED FOOD IN THERE!"" ""I WANT TO GO OUT - WAIT, NO I DON'T"", ""HOW DARE YOU TRIP OVER ME WHILE I'M NAPPING ON THE STAIRS?"" And dear God, their litter trays just stink. Doesn't matter how often the owners clean them out, they always stink!

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to this how Britain, where I was born and raised and currently live, is just going to shit - Brexit was a monumental fuck up, and there isn't a single politician in the government that I can think of who is even semi-competent at their job, except maybe the ones from Scotland - at least they know how to get shit done. I honestly just want Brexit to be a complete and total disaster and for the country to fail, and I'm ashamed that it's now basically the 51st state of america, just without the guns. And even if I were to vote in the next election the country has, it doesn't feel like I will ever have any impact on the nation, let alone the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly have hit a point where I just wish I could disappear for a brief period of time - just completely blink out of existence for a bit, or change who I am for a day or something.

I think it can all be traced back to my freshman year when I dated a girl for like a week. It was a stupid 14 year old hormone fueled mess. I wanted to kiss her really badly because I had never kissed a girl, she would not kiss me due to (supposedly) her religion. When I look back on it it was a cringy mess and I regret the whole thing.

Not only that, but I am very opinionated on many subjects. I understand that I can be abrasive but I am by no means hateful towards people or venomous with my words unless I truly find their beliefs disgusting. With that said, my high school is probably about 60% Asian, and they are extremely cliquey. I have, on several occasions, been excluded from groups for my non-asian-ness. I do not think all Asian people are like this, however, at my school the attitude seems to be prevalent. I also think culturally loud and outspoken people may be disapproved of (many of them are 1st or 2nd generation).

I'm a 45 days away from graduation (yes I am counting) and have spent all four years stressing about meaningless grades at a tech high school where every class is markedly more difficult than it would be at any other high school so that  we will be ""prepared for college."" I wasn't thinking about this when I took the test to get in. I shot myself in the foot; the competitive nature of the school makes it markedly more difficult to stand out and get good grades. People sleep for less than two hours a night trying to get their homework and studying out of the way just to survive their intense regiment their parents have forced on them. At any other school I could have probably slid right by. This is not arrogance speaking, the school I am at is specifically known for its hell regiment and tiger parents send their kids their strategically; it almost ends up as a academic cockfight. It's extremely bloody and almost nobody wins in the end. Colleges accept a certain number of kids per school, and at my school everyone is fighting to be one of the extremely small (2-3) number of kids that get accepted to any prestigious schools. Normally competition is good, but at this school children are compelled to sacrifice their mental and physical health for the sake of the school's, their parent's, and their own delusional agendas. This is very much prominent in the Asian community of my school; however, it permeates the entire culture. It is toxic.

Back to me being hated; I spent my high school years pretty much alone, with no substantial friends or relationships for the most part. I had those difficult classes, yes, however, to save myself I avoided taking too many classes in the math and science department. It made me less competitive in the school but at least I had a semblance of a soul left coming out of it. After what happened my freshman year, I retreated away from people at my school. I talked to girls online. From my sophomore year all the way until midway through my junior year I was with a girl I met online; she lived very far. Judge long distance all you want, but she was all I had. I didn't have anyone to hang out with but for basically the first time ever I had someone to talk to, all the while being shunned by everyone at my school. I didn't care. I had her and I loved her dearly; I remained completely loyal to her through the whole time. We took a couple breaks but came back to one another. Then, halfway through junior year, she left me, told me she didn't want to be friends, and that very night got with another guy over me - the person she claimed to love. Once again I was alone. It broke me.

Then, I got with another girl a few months later. Someone ACTUALLY from my high school liked me. She was also hated by the school. I guess outcasts end up together. She was the same age as me but she was a year higher, and she was headed to college in another faraway state. YUP THAT'S FRIGGEN RIGHT. Against my better judgement I got into yet another long distance relationship. She and I dated for a long time into Summer. It was MUCH more difficult to fall in love with her, she had a lot of problems that I had to accept and the relationship was very rocky, however, I am what is known as ""loyal to a fault"" and that gets me into these miserable situations. She leaves, of course I stay with her. Her parents were abusive (THEY MOVED WITH HER TO HER SCHOOL), the team she went to that college for kicked her out, and everything went to shit for her. She began clinging to me (even harder. She was already very clingy). I love(d) her and endured; with her life having gone this direction she resolved to return back to her home (away from her abusive parents) once she turned 18. She and I clung to this plan. When her 18th birthday was looming, I received an anonymous message telling me she had cheated. I trusted her and didn't think it was true. I decided to look into it and found out a semblance of a story: She went to a Halloween party, a guy forced a kiss on her, she was scared and didn't know what to do, and for MONTHS hid this from me purposefully. When I was coming close to finding out, she was texting behind my back trying to cover herself. Apparently she ""couldn't lose me."" I left her... very painfully, after this. I couldn't trust her, and there were just too many things that made me uncomfortable, that lying for that long was the final straw. How was I to know if she wasn't lying about more things after this? We were both devastated.

&amp;#x200B;

That was January, now it is April. Three weeks ago my friend (not at my high school anymore) and I (kinda?) started a relationship. She really liked me, and I liked her. However, I don't know if I am hung up on my ex, guilty, or just broken. I ended it and told her I wanted to be friends. I really did appreciate her as a friend. I had pretty much never connected with someone so closely in my life. She even came over to my house and chilled (something that happens extremely rarely). We totally got each other. I absolutely loved being her friend, I thought we could be best friends. Two days ago she told me that she thought she could be friends, but that she couldn't because she had feelings for me and needed ""to move forward."" I think that's a load of crap, because we dated for like a week; there was no time to fall in love or anything... Needless to say I'm pissed at her right now for pretending to appreciate me as a friend only to bail... like everyone always. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am talking to another girl I met, and I like her, and she likes me. Still, I can't seem to commit, and I keep telling her to stop wasting her time. She sticks around, and she's telling me she isn't talking to other guys. This girl and I have known each other for like three weeks so I really don't understand how she already likes me so much, as a I consider myself to be nothing special. I can't seem to bring myself to let it go anywhere, something inside of me is just stopping me, and I feel horrible for doing that to her. I have been completely transparent about it, but she chooses to stick around. What the hell is actually wrong with me man? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I did not expect to vent about my whole life story. I was actually just going to end it at how much my school hates me and how much I loathe going. The rest sort of just poured out.

And me? I play chauffeur when the boys need a ride to college/high school and/or their work. They pay for the gas in my car, as I only drive them around. I've got nowhere to go myself. 

It's no surprise that my wife &amp; I aren't doing so hot either. We sleep in separate  rooms &amp; have sex (maybe) once a year, if that. Not that I'm complaining. I'm sure she's cheating.

Every day I sit at home with our three dogs (one male chocolate Labrador Retriever, one female chocolate Labrador Retriever &amp; one female Rottweiler puppy) and I re-live the same day again &amp; again....and again.

So I'm almost 20 and I don't have a job and I don't go to school, I am looking for a job but it's hard when you have ZERO experience and are a drop out. Luckily I can apply for a bunch of stuff for financial aid things and I am but I have no idea what I'm doing but thanks to a friend (he's telling me what I have to do) I finally do and they've offered to come with if need be. 

NOW here's where this begins.(might be long get some popcorn) 

So I moved back in with my mother and it was honestly the last thing I wanted to do but I did it anyway because it really isn't that bad it's just my mom .*sigh* So because I have no job one would usually ask for money BUT I don't. Like seriously I really don't even ask for train fair. The reason for that being I asked once and was basically lectured and all I asked for was 10 dollars as though I was making her break bank. Now I understand she can tell me no it's not a problem but the fact of the matter was before I even moved back she was asking me to move back in to help with my brother because he's a little out of control. So you'd think if she asked me to move back knowing that I don't have a job that she'd be there to support me if needed. 

So I don't ask for money EVER. If she wants me to do something and offers me money I of course take it being I don't get some kind of an allowance being I do all the house work (cooking, cleaning, taking care of a 12 year old and yes even the bathroom). But usually she doesn't offer and I don't mind. But I had ran out of shampoo and conditioner and I have curly hair so I can't just us any conditioner.

 THIS is the only thing that I'm a stickler about, the only thing I'm very particular about. LITTERALLY ONLY THIS! now when you have curly hair you can't just wash with anything or my hair will get poofy and I'll look like a dog who was electrocuted, so I said to my mom if I could get some money or if she could get me some shampoo and conditioner. And she said ""we have some already"" to which I said ""I can't use it because it's not good for my hair type, can I please go get some more?"" And then she basically yelled at me. 

I get why you wouldn't want to buy the shampoo I've got before it's a little pricey but nothing crazy but just the fact that I don't ask for anything, not food, not snacks, not train fair (I live in NY) not my phone bill, NOTHING, and I don't complain about taking care of her son pushing my plans on the back burner, dropping things to take care of my kid brother and making sure he does good in school and not getting paid for the countless hours that I'm with him and being a parent to him. You'd think shampoo and conditioner wouldn't be a big deal. 

 I can already hear the backlash ""she's you mom"" and ""your family, that what family does"" but just hear me out. All I asked for was soap and it was a big deal, I sleep on basically a piece of toast and have massive back problems because of it because i don't want her to spend the money. I have the smallest amount of clothes that when I do laundry I'm washing ALL OF the clothes I have and it fits into one load of laundry and i don't want clothes because I don't want her to spend on me. I have one pair of shoes and they just got a hole in them because I wear them everyday and I don't ask for new ones because I don't want her to spend on me. 

But if I simply ask her for some shampoo and conditioner it's a fucking problem. But if her boyfriend need something shell get it for him, my kid brother needs five dollars shell give him 20. But if I need soap and I ask her for 20 dollars for soap, apparently I'm breaking her whole bank after that 20 dollars she's gonna have to work double were not ganna be able to eat, we need to sell the house. All over 20 fucking dollars.

The funny part is I'm not even exaggerating I get yelled at, lectured and hit way more then my older sibling an my kid brother. They don't even get yelled at or hit but me, I'm fucking target 101. I get treated like I'm never enough, like I'm some kinda mistake and I should just dissaper. I've always tried my hardest to get some kinda of ""I'm proud of you"" from her but I guess all i am to her is a nuisance. 

To think all this came from the fact that I ran out of shampoo and conditioner...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now your more then welcome to keep scrolling or you can read this but just so you know, I am complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m almost 20 and I don&amp;#39;t have a job and I don&amp;#39;t go to school, I am looking for a job but it&amp;#39;s hard when you have ZERO experience and are a drop out. Luckily I can apply for a bunch of stuff for financial aid things and I am but I have no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing but thanks to a friend (he&amp;#39;s telling me what I have to do) I finally do and they&amp;#39;ve offered to come with if need be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW here&amp;#39;s where this begins.(might be long get some popcorn) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I moved back in with my mother and it was honestly the last thing I wanted to do but I did it anyway because it really isn&amp;#39;t that bad it&amp;#39;s just my mom .&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; So because I have no job one would usually ask for money BUT I don&amp;#39;t. Like seriously I really don&amp;#39;t even ask for train fair. The reason for that being I asked once and was basically lectured and all I asked for was 10 dollars as though I was making her break bank. Now I understand she can tell me no it&amp;#39;s not a problem but the fact of the matter was before I even moved back she was asking me to move back in to help with my brother because he&amp;#39;s a little out of control. So you&amp;#39;d think if she asked me to move back knowing that I don&amp;#39;t have a job that she&amp;#39;d be there to support me if needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#39;t ask for money EVER. If she wants me to do something and offers me money I of course take it being I don&amp;#39;t get some kind of an allowance being I do all the house work (cooking, cleaning, taking care of a 12 year old and yes even the bathroom). But usually she doesn&amp;#39;t offer and I don&amp;#39;t mind. But I had ran out of shampoo and conditioner and I have curly hair so I can&amp;#39;t just us any conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS is the only thing that I&amp;#39;m a stickler about, the only thing I&amp;#39;m very particular about.

I can post here no problem. I don't know anyone really, so it's fine. Here's MY problem though: I have social anxiety. Mine is pretty specific though - it's direct communication that's the problem. 

Examples: sending or receiving email, OMG PHONE CALLS are the WORST, responding to questions once I know you, etc. It's very frustrating. My friends have no clue just how much I have to psyche myself up to email a person. It's SO HARD. I know how stupid that is, it's just like what I am doing on Reddit, but it never seems to penetrate through the anxiety. 

Example: I get an email that says ""hey, haven't heard from you lately. Just wondered how you and the family are doing. TTYL.

I will open that message 30 times before ever responding. Either that, or I'll avoid that email, but every time I catch a glimpse of it, my anxiety will SKY ROCKET. Ditto for messenger messages.

I have no idea how to tell people this. It sounds so stupid, that if I were you, I would respond with ""are you seriously this dumb? Just answer people, it's not hard"". 

I end up completely avoiding it, then I have to pretend I didn't see it, and tell them THAT'S why it took me a year to respond. ""Oh, I'm just now seeing this...haha how funny, sorry about that"". 
The simplest things are torture. 

I sincerely hate it so much. I'd give anything to just be a normal person who could do normal things. 

I mean, if you respond, I can answer, bc I don't know you. However, if we continued to talk, the more messages we exchange, the harder it gets. Simple things like telling me more about yourself, that starts this weird process that I can't seem to control. Also, some days are much harder than others, so you might hear from me on Monday bc I feel great, but by Wednesday, I'm a complete mess again, and I can't write. What upsets me the most, is I've met new people that have loads in common with me, and I'm sure we could be great friends, but my anxiety is just like 'nah, how about we don't'. 

I don't have this issue with my kids, my husband, or my brother, but beyond that, it's always there. My brain immediately will remind me that I shouldn't be taking to the person bc I'm going to inevitably disappoint them. I shouldn't ask this or that question bc it's stupid, etc. And omg the messages I do write, I'm constantly so focused on making sure I don't offend the person, that I just over explain everything. 

I know, advice would be get some damn therapy, but therapy is for those cool kids who have better insurance (good ole USA). I've got loads on my plate ATM, but I'll get there eventually, just haven't quite worked up to it yet. 

If you made it this far, thx for letting me complain, and I hope you're having a fantastic day today:)

**TL**;**DR** : My Mother....Theres so many issues and Problems To list, but in this story she's Lying, and (most likely) Being a Huge hypocrite and just taking things from me, violating my personal space and my Privacy.

**UPDATE:** Turns out my mother did steal a doll related package from the previous week, and told my father, who told me yesterday, Leading me to think she did Lie and steal the package I got this week from my closet. Also in this same conversation with my father it's (once again) VERY apparent neither of them like my hobby whatsoever. Even though all I do is collect dolls and take pictures of them on social media. 

A few Days ago, around Monday Afternoon, I'm folding some laundry and Get a Notice on my phone about a ebay listing, for a Brunette 90s barbie for about $8 including shipping, that's about to end soon. I decide to get it, knowing that after getting said doll and getting lunch out the next day I get paid at the end of the week (currently job hunting so I make some $$ doing stuff around the house and taking care of the pets). It says it's arriving on Friday. The Next morning (Tuesday), Right as I'm leaving to go get some taco bell for lunch My Mom Tells me to Clean out the floor of my closet so I can Move all the boxes and bins on my floor into my closet because the carpet cleaners are coming on friday to clean my carpet because my room ""Smells like shit"", and that she'll be making room in the garage for the stuff in my closet. I start to get mad and Upset because now I have to figure out what do to about all my doll stuff that's in my closet, which I have to hide from my parents because they don't like their son having dolls. (even if it's a Hobby). I also start to question it she even called carpet people to show up, or if she was just lying to force me to do something. and I wonder if she even put any thought into this because there is 0 room in our Garage, which is more like a storage unit for everyone's stuff, especially my mom's. She proceeds to not Mention again it until Wednesday Night, and I start to realize she actually did make the call and someone is coming over on friday. She does Say she's gonna help me clean it out and go through with stuff, and I start to panic again and try to figure out where to put my doll stuff. Thursday rolls around and She Says she's going to work but coming home early to help me out. It works out for me because I get some time alone to hide my main doll box in the attic, while the 2 smaller backpacks I just mix in with the other backpacks of stuff in my closet i'm keeping. By the time she comes home I finished taking everything out and moving all the boxes and bins into my closet. I go and take out some trash, and when I come back I notice she brought in the mail, and notice a package with an ebay sticker on  it. My mom usually only orders from amazon and sometimes esty, so i look through the mail to see if I got any regular mail, and when I get to the package I see my name on it and realize it's the doll i ordered, which Came a day early. I quickly stash it in my closet on top of a stack of boxes. When I come back to see if my mom needs anything she goes ""WAS THAT MY PACKAGE???"" Because even though she's told me ""I always Get packages"", I only get packages the month around or after Christmas and/or my birthday, when I have extra spending money to get stuff like Games and Dolls. My Mother however Gets packages almost every week, sometimes multiple packages a day.  I tell her no and she simply goes ""oh"". She then tells me Get the rest of the stuff in the other corner of my room off the floor and into my closet, and starts asking about stuff on my top shelf, which I tell he no I'm not worrying about that right now. She then starts to get on my case and I should get rid of more stuff. My (gay) cousin comes over to help clean the house around this time. Among the shuffle of doing all this and other random things she has me do I remember my doll came in and is in my closet and go to check if she's there, and thankfully she is, for now. A little Later on after almost everything is taken care of, I hear my Mom and Cousin talking about going to RuPaul's DragCon in may, and I start to get annoyed because She Hates me Having dolls but has 0 problem with going to a Drag Queen Convention. At this point, maybe earlier idk it's been a long day, I Call her a hyporcite because she Complains about my dad having several bikes, while she herself HAS AN ENTIRE ROOM OF JUST CLOTHES AND SHOES. I soon realize this is a mistake and decide to end the conversation there and not talk about it, as to not anger the beast further, and was put on the spot and couldn't think of any other specific examples. As I take out some more Trash I realize she didn't make any room in the Garage and in fact just tossed everything in the trash, despite mentioning maybe having a yard sale soon to get rid of stuff. Anyways I finish up cleaning my room and doing chores, so  I play GTA online for a little under an hour. I start doing some other stuff and remember about my doll, and go to make sure she's still there and hasn't fallen behind any boxes or anything, and It's Gone. I Start to freak out and start taking stuff out and I can't find her. Before I can continue my search My Mother comes in, on the phone with dad asking what I want him to pick up for dinner. I say IDK because I'm more worried about the doll I lost than the fast food I'm about to eat. I then Decide on Del Taco for Dinner, and My mom decides to take me herself, so I don't get the chance to keep looking for my doll. On the way to del taco she asks what I got in he mail, and I lie and say ""I got a star wars thing"" remembering a Kylo ren figure I have that's about the size of a barbie. After we Get home and I eat my food, I start taking boxes and stuff out of my closet, going through everything, and I just can't find her, she's gone. My mind then starts to Ponder the Idea that maybe during all the times I was out of my room today she came in and Took My Package, thinking it was hers, or maybe because she knows I ordered a Doll. I try checking the rest of my closet but I know It wouldn't be there. I start to realize maybe she did take it. I spend the rest of the evening going from Being very Angry and pissed off, to just Sad and Depressed, That My Stuff was Taken, that my Privacy  was Violated, and the Feeling that I can't be Happy, that Maybe my mom is just trying to ruin my life. My Mom's been Getting on my Nerves more and more over the past many months, but this is the Final straw. I can not deal with her shit anymore. Fuck Her. Apologies that this was very long.

I am a 24 year old female who has a reliable job and living with my fiancee for over a year now. I have five tattoos, size 0 gauges, and an eyebrow ring visible. My bosses encourage me to express myself. 

My mother has always hated piercings with a passion, and never let me have them when I lived with her. I moved out a year ago, next month. Since then, I did all of the piercings. Today I celebrated being at my job for over a year, and being a top earner, by getting another facial piercing. (Lip)

My mother and I have had a rocky relationship but we have gotten on better terms since Ive moved out. I visit her weekly, and have mentioned getting another piercing. I had even posted a poll on FB about it. I posted pictures of me looking very happy with my new piercing about an hour after getting it. So making it public. Que the drama.

I was about to take a nap and decided to send her an I love you. She responds with ""ok"" and I call her. She answers, ""What"", I say ""whats wrong"", ""You know I saw it. This is just ridiculous another hole in your face"" and hangs up. Im sorry, but whats ridiculous is her attitude. I dont live with her, and all of these piercings can be taken out. They arent permanent like the FIVE TATTOOS she never once acted like this over. Ive talked to her about it and she says she just doesnt like piercings. I just don't understand how this is my problem?

You see, I am a full time student in college. 12 credits is enough to be defined as full time, but that's only 3 classes to me. Back in Fall Term (September-December) I had 12 credits. I saw that the bookstore on campus was hiring, and I got a casual position as a cashier on bare minimum wage. It wasnt great but it was my first job, and I liked it there. 

As part of my being hired, I had to have my records changed in the s hopl system so that I could have access to not only student tabs in my portal but the employee tabs as well. That had to go through HR in some other location off-campus. 

So I started working the First week of December after my interview in November. It was fun, but I had a lot to learn. I didn't make very many mistakes, but I was being extra slow and cautious since I was unfamiliar with the register. Typical things any employer should expect.

The bookstore was training me for the first week of the next term (after the holidays) when everyone rushed in to get textbooks. Anyone who has tried to get textbooks knows the pain. It's like a 3 hour process and you spend hundreds of dollars in one go. It's not fun for anyone.

To make it easier, employees told customers to full out slips with their class, subject and level (i.e. PHY 101 or something), where the class was located (there are multiple campus locations, so we stocked books for our campus only, and if they needed books for another campus it would have to be shipped to our location or the customer would have to go to the other location themselves), and if they wanted their books new or used on a first-come-first-served basis. 

My job during the rush was to sit at the table outside the store and stop people on the way in so that they would fill out the paper with my help before going in. If they went in without their form, they would be sent back out to me again and have to go to the end of the line. So I made many warnings to those who tried to slip by that it would be better off if they just followed our procedures so everything would go smoothly. After all, you dont just bust into a doctors office without filling out forms. Only this one wasn't as painful. They had all the info on their phones, and had me to help them find it.

But alas. People lied and waltzed right in, saying they already filled one out or that they were just grabbing a few supplies. Even once they got to the front of the textbook line, it was store policy that books were kept in a warehouse for employees only to access, and we got the books or told them how to get them if we did not have it, and we gave them a laminated number to hold onto while they stood in line for checkout, and we carried their books behind the checkout counter with the corresponding laminated number on top. This was to keep thefts down whole there were hundreds of people coming in and out of the store. If supplies were stolen, it wouldnt be as dramatic as stealing hundreds of dollars in textbooks. 

Overall the process took about 3 hours between filling the form for a few minutes, standing in line, then getting all the books, then maybe looking for supplies, then standing in another line for checkout. 

It was also our policy to help those with small children or with disabilities first. No matter what, they were served first. This got a lot of grief from other customers who felt entitled enough to complain that they had to wait another few minutes. But maybe they would appreciate that we took care of them first so that the small children would not start throwing tantrums in the store. 

Anyway, after 6 weeks of working there, and supposedly getting my profile changed, I didnt get paid for a while. It was a bi-weekly basis, but it wasn't until mid-February that I was paid. 

Furthermore, once the rush week was over, I was told I could stay employed and fill out my schedule for the next term. But I was never scheduled again and at the time I was raising the issue that I had not been paid and would like assistance finding someone to talk to about the issue. 

I also had 16 credits (4 classes) booked for Winter term, but I was certain that I could keep the same schedule. But they never talked to me or responded to my emails again. I emailed them to put me on the schedule because I needed the money, but they never responded, ignored my calls, and the manager left every time I came in to talk.

The funny thing is I was never terminated. I am still an ""active"" employee. But they avoid me like the plague. And rather than scheduling me for the next rush week, they hired a whole new set of trainees. Never once asked me to come work. 

So after finals for winter, and over spring break, I got another job and emailed the bookstore that they would then have to work around my other job schedule. At this job, I am training, but it is far better than the college bookstore. I am having fun and, more importantly, they will schedule me on a regular basis. I couldn't be happier.

&lt;p&gt;I also had 16 credits (4 classes) booked for Winter term, but I was certain that I could keep the same schedule. But they never talked to me or responded to my emails again. I emailed them to put me on the schedule because I needed the money, but they never responded, ignored my calls, and the manager left every time I came in to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is I was never terminated. I am still an &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; employee. But they avoid me like the plague. And rather than scheduling me for the next rush week, they hired a whole new set of trainees. Never once asked me to come work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after finals for winter, and over spring break, I got another job and emailed the bookstore that they would then have to work around my other job schedule. At this job, I am training, but it is far better than the college bookstore. I am having fun and, more importantly, they will schedule me on a regular basis. I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

I show him my ID, show where it indicates my sex, but he takes a look at my picture and says that it's not me. Like wtf?!

reading this won't be worth your time because I'm so scattered I'm not going to be about to stay on one topic.

I'm shaking so bad. I can't think straight. This spring break is supposed to be good but all I can do is sleep and think about all the self- loathing I have. I'm on the phone with the only person I have ever truly trusted and not even he can help me right now. My heart is trembling in my chest and I haven't felt this way in almost a year but the emptiness is slowly clawing its way back into me. I want to curl up in a ball, in complete darkness, and cry. Most importantly, I want to cut. I want to slice open those old scars with one of my razor blades like it's the first time the flesh touched metal. I want to watch that blood pump out of me and I want to feel that euphoria again. Even if it only lasts a minute before I break down crying. My lung trembling with every deep breath I take. I've felt so god damn anxious lately. I start shaking and sweating over nothing and I feel like I'm retreating into that darkness I was buried in 3 and a half months ago. I wanted to leave my own plane of existence so bad. He had no clue. I would drink every single night, I'd snort muscle relaxers and take my anxiety meds like it was candy just to triple the effects. I was hoping and praying for the minute I would die. I don't feel like that now and I don't know why. Maybe he's saving me and I just don't know it. He's trying to talk to me but I can't force the words out. I want to so badly. I want to be in his arms. I want to listen to his heart pull me down from my floating disassociation with each beat. I want him to pull me back. I feel so selfish for wanting anything from anyone anymore. I never ask much of the people around me. Especially my dad. I mentioned to him that I wanted the boy I speak of to come over for a day and I told him it was only if he said it could happen. He said he'd think about it but he makes me feel like I'm asking the god damn universe from him. I was out of stuff to drink and while I was asleep he threw the bottles into my room. Now all I can do is stare at them and think of how shitty of a daughter I am and how much I wish I could kill myself to end his suffering of being a parent. My skin is itching for me to open up that jewelry box and pull out those old blades. My hands are shaking to use that blade like a scalpel on my hip bones. The ones you can't see. I wish I could watch my bones moving underneath my tight skin. I've deprived my body of 2 daily meals for so long now that when I do eat I feel sick. It doesn't work either, starving yourself. You'll just stay in one weight zone and you won't leave it unless you actually start doing something healthy for yourself. Too bad your anxiety keeps you from eating when you're supposed to. Too bad every single time I think about eating school lunch in front of everyone I want to hide from my own body. I dig crescent moons into my hands anytime my anxiety spikes because I just need that pain to release those endorphins into my oh so dumb brain. Even after writing this much my hands still shake. My body aches and I want to cry until I'm dehydrated. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENSITIVE TOPICS!!!

People who have depression or commit suicide are looked down upon as being weak or inferior and thats obvious because even some of the most famous people have committed suicide either purposely or by accident and even when its highly publicized and its someone whos famous mental health is still stigmatized and for a few days people talk about how we need change yet nothing ever changes and then it is forgotten only to be talked about again the next there is another suicide. Why cant we as a society understand that these people are just trying to get rid of the pain they feel caused by mental health and instead of trying to talk to someone or get help they chose to END THEIR OWN LIVES because they know if they do those things they will be branded for life. Our society needs real change. People need to know that they can get help without being looked down upon and branded as weak and until we change its only going to continue and its going to get worse and our children will be the ones who will reap what we sew. So think about that the next time someone tries to talk to you or attempts suicide and you think that they're pathetic or attention seeking.

I found it easier to cope with mental illness and was able to reorganize my thoughts so i could be understood. But now people think i&amp;#39;m gay. I&amp;#39;m surrounded by what people would call &amp;quot;chads&amp;quot; and they are great. Mostly because they are my best friends and one of them is a bit of a bodybuilder and has epilepsy and he was kind of a motivate to improve myself partly because we both had the weights of disability. I get asked if i&amp;#39;m gay all the fucking time and it does hurt i wont lie. Not that there is anything wrong with being gay but I&amp;#39;M NOT FUCKING GAY I LIKE GIRLS. One of my classmates in swim class told me i had to have a better posture, make less little kid jokes, deepen my voice and put gel in my hair. But i don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s who i am and even if i change myself it changed nothing. I would feel like a phony if i changed myself that much. Maybe some of it would be good for me but how is everyone else not like me. It seems impossible to be these people. The majority, a supreme hoodie, stylish hair, uses the bathroom to Juul 5 times a day (juul&amp;#39;s and vapes are very popular at my school our school the bathrooms always smell like fruit) , massive friend groups and always has something to talk about. I have a friend who&amp;#39;s a lot like me at least. I&amp;#39;m not trying to seem immature but why cant i be like everyone else, why do i have to be like everyone else to avoid this alienation? &lt;/p&gt;

Somewhere in my addled mind, I think I play better while drinking. 

As a bit of backstory, I had a falling out with a group of friends in League, namely three. An 18 y/o college freshman male was preaching to me, 32 y/o college dropout female after other extenuating circumstances (namely undiagnosed mental disorders), after a gripe fest of a hard night's work in a physically more demanding position at my place of employment that there were ""worse things you could be doing,"" I snapped. I let this individual of our group have it. And have *EVERYTHING* that had been bothering me about things he had been doing/saying. 

To be honest, it had been building for a while. I am not an aggressive person. I had tried to just push it under the bridge. Life hadn't truly punched this person in the proverbial (and physical) dick yet. So i tried to let things he was saying slide.

I have gone months begging family/friends for money just to get by. I do have a fairly decent warehouse job now. It is just physically taxing for my not-in-shape body. Let alone I cannot afford my meds or even see a therapist right now. I have been off my meds (depression/anxiety/poor sleep (night terrors) /Adult ADHD) for coming on a year. 

Sidenote: I lost my wallet a few weeks ago with the new insurance information last time I went out to a bar. I called the bar and nothing was turned in. I surmise it's somewhere in my legbeard nest of a home. 

Anyways, I had let this person have it on my way to work. I sent a very long-handed version of everything that had been bothering me about him and things that he ways saying. It boiled down to, ""I think you're an annoying, arrogant little snot.""

I had let our mutual friends know what had transpired, I unleashed my FULL AND UNABASHED opinion known to this individual, then I ran. I left the discord server of all our friends and changed my League name. 

I felt I was fairly close to the other woman of the group, but now she won't even respond to me. Messages, DMs, texts, etc. A mutual friend of ours said she doesn't hate me but she just needs time.

That was 2-3 weeks ago. I had been respectful of their wishes and gave space. I haven't messaged, DM'ed, texted or a thing, but she hasn't reached out to me.

Sidenote #B: I am a very socially awkward person. I have an easier time socializing with anons in various games than IRL.  

But I am hurting now. I miss hearing their voices. I miss having a grand old time with them. I wish I had kept my trap shut and waited a bit longer. 

This is probably a long-winded version of, ""I MISS MY FRENS BAWWWW!"" but I do truly miss them.  I reached out to our mutual friend tonight but... they might be less than responsive.

I hate my boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been together for 5 years. I can only say we've been truly happy for one year-the first year we were together. We rushed things. I constantly blame myself. We moved into an apartment together a month after me met and we've lived together since. 3 years ago our apartment building closed and we moved into my parents house. We're still there.

I truly hate him. He's controlling, abusive. Constantly says he doesn't love me and how much happier he would be without me YET he will not leave. He says the only reason he stays with me is because of our cat. My cat, that I've had since I was 11 years old. He's obsessed with her, I can't blame him, she's a snuggler. 

He tells me that I'm gross, that I deserve to die. That I got all of my bad qualities from my parents. This really drives me crazy. My family is by no means perfect. But they let us both live here for free and constantly help us out however they can - they're not bad people and they don't deserve to be talked about in that way. He has not worked for 2 years. He had one job, for a week, quit, made $1,500.... Somehow, to him, this makes everything ok. Even-stevens.

I'm depressed, stressed, and I just hate him. I'm always looking for a way out. But he wont leave. Every time I tell him I'm done, that I don't love him, that I want him out - He pretends to pack his shit, makes a huge mess and then never actually leaves. He threatens to call my job, tell them I'm a criminal and make me lose my job. (I have a past but it's my past. I'm not that person and I've worked hard to rebuild myself and make good on my mistakes) He threatens to smear my name across town, to make it impossible for me to ever work again. He threatens to leak out naked photos of me. 

I'm on the edge. Every day I wish I could just pack up my kitty and run away to where ever. Anywhere has to be better than this. 

I don't really have any friends I can talk about this to since he has made me cut off any relationships I had prior to meeting him. So all my ""friends"" are work colleagues and I don't really want them knowing the personal hell I live in every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

They’re rare with him and they usually only happen when he gets something out of them too. We have different live languages and attachment styles, that’s for sure. I know all this and try to adjust. He doesn’t really track ideas and actions like this. He is certain I I think Tom much and overthink everything. I’m certain he underthinks everything. 

I think the thing that confuses and angers me the most is when he does things he absolutely knows will upset or hurt me and then tells me about it. Then he’s *shocked* that I’m upset (he knew I would be) and gets angry at me for being upset. It is like a repeating game of asserting his independence or some shit? He says he feels like he’s always on eggshells (I do too) so there isn’t a psychological mystery here. He gets sick of that feeling - like he has to not be who he is - and does what he wants and refuses to compromise his behaviors at all. That’s fine, but it also leaves me hurt and confused. Why? Because this is stuff that agrees to try to compromise on then doesn’t and wonders how and why I’m upset. I follow through on my promises and compromises and I find that increasingly painful because it leaves me even further in the hole of resentment when I change my behavior with him in mind and he doesn’t bother to reciprocate. He even goes so far as to have two standards: one for his behavior and one for mine. The hypocrisy is really hard to swallow. The resentment grows. 

Examples, you ask? 
1. I buy a special meal and he tells me how excited he is.  I text from work how I’m looking forward to it for the evening meal and he informs me he already ate his half without me while I’m at work. Here we didn’t have an explicit agreement, but he knew it would upset me. It was clear in how he told me he did it. So he knew. 
2. I buy special expensive buffalo grass seed for the lawn and want to sew it in a special way so it has the best chance to take root. He flings it on the ground at the wrong time of year...after hearing my plan for seeing and agreeing to it. His yard trumps the fact that it is my seed and I’m the master gardener in the family. It didn’t grow. $108 waste. 
3. He has an old flame who comes to some of his shows. She’s a low-class flirt with him. He reciprocates in kind and it really upsets me. He thinks I’m dumb to be upset, but he agrees it is disrespectful to me and to cut that out on his end. He agrees to tell her not to paw him and to introduce me as who I am so his lines are clear. He says she’s trash and he detests her, but he obviously likes the attention because the same damn scenario plays out each time he sees her (5-6 times now in the last year and a half). So, you guessed it, he goes back on his word each time and she gets bolder in her moves and I get in more and more trouble for being upset. Over something he agreed not to do. I don’t get it.

When he does stuff he knows will upset me he clearly knows it is against out agreements or plans. How in the world is he surprised or angry at me for being upset? Why make a plan and go against it then wonder why you’ve upset your partner? 

I’ve given up on being sad that he isn’t thoughtful. He simply doesn’t speak my love language so I’m  trying to learn his. But when he’s just brutally thoughtless? It even seems purposeful? WHY?

I have to vent about something because it’s driving me crazy. I would like to point out this happened a few months ago and I really shouldn’t be upset still.  This was a life lesson and I’m doing so much better but I have got to get this off my chest. 

I was talking to this man who I shared a lot of my mental struggles with. He kinda would play with my mind with flirting sending eggplant emojis and then trying to play it off like he wasn’t interested. Which I got over cause I figured men are men but here’s the real issue. The thing that’s bothering me sooo much is that throughout talking I kinda figured as a person he cared somewhat about my feelings (as far as my mental health is concerned). 
I reached out to him about wanting to harm myself and he completely didn’t care. The reason why all these emotions surfaced again is because I looked on his Instagram I saw back when this all happened and I was taken to the hospital he made a post about how I’m crazy and obsessed with him and joking about the whole thing. The facts that he thinks it was about being in a relationship with him is obnoxious and annoying but the part that the whole experience didn’t make him think AT ALL. Like damn, maybe I was wrong a little? Maybe I should apologize or something? This post is probably really hard to follow and some parts of the story are cut out or this would be soooo long.

It was me for a long time and now it's back to me again. The first time was when corporate was trying out a new position I was selected for that did frying/prep as my main job rather than making food on the line with some frying/ prep only when not busy the way food people usually do things. One of my side duties was to ***help*** the people on the line stay stocked but as I got better at noticing when people were running out and when to give them more my coworkers got lazier and lazier and soon they weren't doing whole parts of their jobs. They'd leave it to me. Then the cashiers got the same idea and pretty soon I was everyone's waterboy.  This didn't get corrected by any of the managers until the position got deleted. Eventually, some wonderful coworkers showed up who helped out like I do, unfortunately they stayed for about three to six months then left because they understandably got sick of it. The last one actually lost it because she was berated for calling in sick 12 hours ahead of her shift with the stomach flu! They said ""how's she going to know she'll still be sick 12 hours from now?"" It's the stomach flu, it doesn't disappear in half a day! That girl was gone a week and a half and only came up that early because of the guilt! That's terrible and it wasn't the only time this happened! FOUR PEOPLE, including a shift manager turned up sick a few days ago. If I wasn't so afraid of losing my job I'd report them all. The shift manager didn't even want to come, the General manager basically forced her saying how they wouldn't be able to get anyone else in and a manager is required to be on shift at all times. To be honest, I want out just the same as those that left, but I know how they'll react when they find out so I have to keep quiet about it to not make my time there even harder. They act like that person is the ultimate scumbag who 'tricked everyone into training them for this job only for them to leave once they got good.' I need to set up my next job before I do anything but damn do they piss me off! Last night, once everyone I had been working with for the first half of my shift rotated out, I was suddenly nagged at for ***everything*** I did or said. For example, when drive thru or inside gets done with our orders, we're supposed to offer to help the other side catch up their stuff so our time per order stays down. I did so and the person on the other side goes ""YOU'RE GETTING REALLY ANNOYING TODAY, I'M DONE WITH YOU! WHAT DO YOU MEAN,YOU DON'T THINK I CAN FINISH MY ORDERS ON MY OWN OR SOMETHING? I GOT THIS, DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME!!!"" Even when I clocked out and I was resting me feet after walking around for almost 9 hours straight (15 minutes between walking to work and when my shift started) one of my coworkers asks if I'll be having my employee meal. I say ""oh, I'm fine. I used it for lunch, before I started my shift."" She responds ""***UH*** Ok, _____, how am ***I*** supposed to know you had lunch. I was just offering to get your food ***geez***."" ...I know that. That's why I explained nicely...? Because you had no way of knowing... I can't even do anything to relax after work usually. I just force some easy to make dinner into my mouth at home and go to sleep, too tired to do anything else, and often stress dreaming as a result of what happened at work.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they start to get stressed out about all the orders coming into the restaurant (fast food) they pick someone to just fucking hate and berate for the rest of the day/ night. it often feels like the person who does the most is the one they choose. It was me for a long time and now it&amp;#39;s back to me again. The first time was when corporate was trying out a new position I was selected for that did frying/prep as my main job rather than making food on the line with some frying/ prep only when not busy the way food people usually do things. One of my side duties was to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the people on the line stay stocked but as I got better at noticing when people were running out and when to give them more my coworkers got lazier and lazier and soon they weren&amp;#39;t doing whole parts of their jobs. They&amp;#39;d leave it to me. Then the cashiers got the same idea and pretty soon I was everyone&amp;#39;s waterboy.  This didn&amp;#39;t get corrected by any of the managers until the position got deleted. Eventually, some wonderful coworkers showed up who helped out like I do, unfortunately they stayed for about three to six months then left because they understandably got sick of it. The last one actually lost it because she was berated for calling in sick 12 hours ahead of her shift with the stomach flu! They said &amp;quot;how&amp;#39;s she going to know she&amp;#39;ll still be sick 12 hours from now?&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s the stomach flu, it doesn&amp;#39;t disappear in half a day! That girl was gone a week and a half and only came up that early because of the guilt! That&amp;#39;s terrible and it wasn&amp;#39;t the only time this happened!

Not to mention the relationship has already been really toxic. We took a break for the past few days, going so much as to almost not talk to each other at all. Which was good I felt free for the first time in a long time. I’ve been spending time with his friend and for simplicity let’s call this friend friend A. My current boyfriend will go by the name Tom. I’ve known friend A for a really long time almost 6 years now and they’ve always supported me. Listened to me talk about my problems even if their mind was in other places. That is amazing and they were only proceeded to show me so much more care and affection. I’m torn because they are a really cuddly person. It’s hard to tell if they had feelings for someone and they told me once; “you’ll know if I have feelings for you you’ll know if I’m flirting”. I don’t think that’s true I’m afraid that I fell for someone who,

1. doesn’t like me back and has stated it before 
2. someone that is just cuddly in general to the point that I’m not going to be able to tell if they did develop feelings. 

I feel like I’ve fallen so deep into someone’s arms that our problems are intertwined. Friend A admitted to having feelings for me at least I think that’s what it was.  It was more like admitting to if we had a relationship it would be toxic. For past mistakes that he’s made.  Ever since then I don’t know I’ve still felt just as close to them as I ever did. If not closer.  I feel like I know him so well and there’s still so much of that I can discover about him. I just want to be there for him even if it’s just in a small way. To be honest I just don’t know anymore it’s hard to love someone, at least I think this is love. Knowing you can’t do anything. I can’t just explain these feelings. I don’t think he would understand where they’re coming from. or just how much they mean to me. 

Then there’s the problem that I’m in a relationship that’s destroying me mentally. I’ve really liked Tom for quite a while and we recently got together and it’s been about four months now and there’s just so much that has gone wrong he’s overly clingy and obsessive. 

It’s a all take, no give. Every time we talk on the phone in person it’s always about him and his problems and it’s changed a little bit since I brought this up but I’m always left feeling drained. Not only that it’s always after we talk I am left feeling drained. Instead of feeling happy and productive, always mentally, emotionally, and even physically drained. He’s always afraid of friend a taking me and I guess I can’t blame him for that considering our history and of course my feelings towards friend A. It’s awaits such a hostile atmosphere. Especially between all three of us and we used to be really good friends. His mom his mother doesn’t like my family and she’s constantly giving this continuous disrespect. Towards me my privacy and my family and their privacy. For quite a little while we had this mutual avoidance of all of these problems recently. As we were talking on the phone.  He admitted as well as I did I do take responsibility for avoiding these problems because I wanted to remain blissful. And when I mentioned wanting to maybe break up he started making me feel guilty for that feeling. When I told him to stop he agreed that he was manipulating me to make me want to stay. This left me feeling worthless and alone.  It’s packed with uncertainty, these empty feelings, envy, and I feel like it brings out the worst in me. He’s always lowering his standards for me. He’s always cutting himself down like he’s not worthy and I hate that he doesn’t and I can’t stop him. Somehow I feel like he’s always the victim. I really feel trapped in this relationship and it’s not changing. He told me to compile a list of what he does wrong so that he can fix it when I feel like this isn’t something you put into a list and shop for the groceries to fix. I haven’t made a list yet. I can’t bring myself to terms to do so.

I told friend A this and that I wanted to break up with Tom friend A said, that I should wait another month. This was about the 26th of last month. I’ve told Tom what I feel towards the situation and the idea of waiting a month. He went on saying that all of friend A’s actions were because he liked me. That friend A has a motive to break us up so that he can get with me. Friend A has already stated that he used to like me and probably doesn’t now. He didn’t say that he doesn’t now, but based on the context. It usually means I did like you and now I don’t. Which is confusing we hung out last weekend at a park. He had this look in his eyes when he would help me. He was so cuddly and sweet but he is usually like that. He and I then decided to go back and hang out with another group of friends. He stopped being cuddly when we started hanging out with this other group. He wasn’t cuddling with anyone else.  Then the following Monday from the weekend we hung out at another park. Just us and he fell asleep on my lap. he’s really tired a lot and doesn’t get very much sleep.  But it wasn’t exactly peculiar. For him to fall asleep. I guess, I did give him a shoulder rub because. He works a physical job so he had a lot of knots in her shoulder blades and neck. But after hanging out he left so abruptly we walked back to his place. Which wasn’t too far. I was getting a ride so he just went inside granted, he had already stated they needed to go to the bathroom but I didn’t even say goodbye.

You get no decent schedule and are expected to show up on time or early even with a smile. Take your '15' minute break, but not a second more or else youre docked 15 minutes on your pay and guess what!? DONT FORGET TO SMILE! 

If you are called to come in on a day off, dont even think about saying no, because if you do, expect them to punish you for it, but dont you dare forget to smile. 

If you need to make an appointment you better give 2 weeks notice but dont expect them to make any effort in trying to make it work for you and dont you dare call in sick, otherwise they will remeber it forever and ruin your references, but please do not forget to smile! 

You want to try and find another job, in order to compensate the fact that they dont pay you enough, or give you enough hours a week to pay your rent, but they tell you that you have to be available 24/7, and hey, smile on your way out of my office thanks!  

You then decide to ask if it would be okay to go back to school (even if it is a TRAM) and they tell you that there are no part-time positions available, even though they're still hiring for part- time positions... dont think about the logic girl, just SMILE! 

Wake up in the morning and eat your dry toast with weak coffee, and take a drag of your cigarette, which you're secretly hoping kills you before you have to start your shift, but don't forget to smile! 

Decide between taking the bus or walking; knowing that the 3,25$ could also buy you 1L of milk, but you're really tired from your long week of work and it's fucking cold outside; you decide to be reaponsible and you start to walk, but you forget to smile.

You have a bunch of bills to pay and your job barely affords the roof over your head, but you need that job because thats what allows you to eat sometimes and to not sleep in the street. Its a thankless way to live and you do not exist. You do not matter, but its better than nothing so please, do not forget to smile!

&lt;p&gt;Decide between taking the bus or walking; knowing that the 3,25$ could also buy you 1L of milk, but you&amp;#39;re really tired from your long week of work and it&amp;#39;s fucking cold outside; you decide to be reaponsible and you start to walk, but you forget to smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a bunch of bills to pay and your job barely affords the roof over your head, but you need that job because thats what allows you to eat sometimes and to not sleep in the street. Its a thankless way to live and you do not exist. You do not matter, but its better than nothing so please, do not forget to smile! &lt;/p&gt;

I had an abusive ex boyfriend, and it was very, very messy. I had a PPO on him, that expired in October. It was only a six month term, but apparently that wasn't long enough. 

I'll start from the beginning. I'm going to air out all my dirty laundry here. 

I got out of the Navy a few days before my 19th birthday in 2016, and was in a very dark place. Turns out, I was born with rheumatoid arthritis, and because my mother was/is an antivaxxer, and refused to get me tested for anything, I didn't know. I was told it was just growing pains, so as you can imagine, I got a medical discharge after 6 months. I needed a job, and finally got one at Walmart, and Speedway. I would work third shift at speedway, and first/second shift at Walmart. I felt like death all the time, and I still lived with my mother. I was already in a long distance relationship with someone I met in the Navy, not Asshole yet. 

When going to orientation for Walmart, I saw him for the first time. He was a bit chubby, dark hair, pretty quiet and kind of cute. Didn't seem off at the time. We both got assigned to the garden section, so we worked together often. He very obviously tried flirting with me, and I politely told him I had a boyfriend. So he respected that, for a while.

We talked about this show, Steven Universe, and I found out he'd never seen it. So he said I should come over with a few of our work friends and binge it. I reluctantly agreed, and when I got there, not even his roommate was home. He gave me a ride there, directly from work, because I didn't have a license at the time, let alone a car. There were no bus routes to my mothers, unfortunately. So it was get a ride home from him, or call my mother. Neither worked out. I ended up having to spend the night, and he kept trying to cuddle me. Which made me super uncomfortable, and I tried to tell him. I'm a 4'11"" female and I'm pretty quiet and nonconfrontational. So I just dealt with it at the time. 

My mother has always been very controlling, so she was furious I was doing this. I didn't care, though I was suppose to be having a friend over the next morning for Shuto Con (google it) and I kept asking her to please come get me, she just told me to fend for myself. I'm cheap, and didn't want to spend nearly 50 dollars on an Uber. 

So I spent the night. And he told me he was a virgin, at 22. Well, by the next morning, he wasn't. And I felt like it was my fault, because..I should've fought harder. I should've screamed. Something. But I let it happen, and I was already so depressed I just..didn't say anything. I have a tendency to distance myself from people I love when I'm depressed. So I immediately just...broke up with the Navy guy. I didn't tell him what happened, I just texted him. And I still feel bad about that. 

So asshole gave me a ride home, and things just went downhill from there. My mother was furious at me (she's always been abusive) and kicked me out. Asshole had an extra room. Said it would be cheap and I wouldn't have to have my name on the lease if I didn't want. Turns out he charged me more than him or his roommate pay. I got the master bedroom in the three bedroom apartment, because the couple they were living with moved out (they were still on the lease, so they paid a small amount monthly, but i took up the majority of the costs from then on). Asshole started telling everyone we were dating, and he was being nice again. So...I didn't correct him. My mother refused to talk to me, my father passed when I was 14 and I haven't talked to that side of the family since, I only had two friends, one from Ohio that I met in the Navy, and one from high school who thought Asshole was PERFECT for me. So. I went along with it. 

He started getting more aggressive, and soon we argued every few days. He started punching the wall, and hitting things when he was mad. He would scream at me and tell me he was the only one that would ever love me and he'd kill himself if I left him. 

The lease was up, and he had already moved into my room. My mother was now speaking to me again, but the littlest things would set her off, so I walked on eggshells around her. She helped ""us"" look for a new place. Big surprise, she picks a place that's a few blocks away from her. We sign the lease together, and move in. We get roommates. 

My mental health spiraled out of control, and in October of 2017, I was admitted to the hospital for attempted suicide. I have clinical depression and anxiety. Big surprise, so does my whole family. Asshole visited me in the hospital, and everyone would comment on how sweet he was. I spent two weeks there, and went home. To him. 

He knows that I want a dog, but didn't listen when I said to wait until we were financially stable. He went and got a dog as a ""birthday gift"" in late October. My birthday is in November. We went to visit my cousin who's cat just had kittens. He wanted one. I said no. Didn't matter. Now we had Tyrian (dog, and Meatball (cat). If you want to know what happened with Meatball, I posted a story of his death on this profile as well. 

I started trying to have more of a social life, which was hard because he was jealous of everyone. Told me no one cared about me except him, etc, etc. Well, I finally said stuff it, and tried to break up with him. Told him to get out. Simple, right? Wrong. 

I was at a friends house down the road (also coworker, AND i knew him from high school. Great guy) making macaroons for the first time, as he was trying to cheer me up, and they were my favorite. Asshole called, and called, and called. I finnaly answered, reluctantly. I heard weird clicking on the other end, and he asked if I ever loved him. I said no. He told me he was holding a shot gun (he had one in the house, unregistered, along with a hand gun) and he couldn't live without me. Hung up. I ran home, and he was sitting on the bed, sobbing, holding the shot gun. So, we got ""back together"" because I couldn't handle this. I then planned on leaving him in a better way. I finally told my loved ones what was happening, and that I was in fear of my safety, as well as my animals. My mother said I should come stay with her, and I had friends take my animals in while everything was being settled because I'd be damned if asshole took either of them, or hurt them any more than he already had. 

So, I stayed at her house while I told him I wanted him out of the house. The leasing office told me I would need to get him to voluntarily get off the lease. He agreed, if he could take one of the empty bedrooms. I said no. He continued to harass me, sent me nasty letters (nsfw and threatening) he would show up at my mothers house and bang on the door, until we threatened to call the police. I kept all his letters, and filed for a PPO (a restraining order) . In this time, he went to Verizon and took out another phone under my name on my contract. An S8, which was fairly new at the time (spring 2018). I had a very long dispute with Verizon that got me only half the cost of the phone credited to my account. 

He was still living in my house at the time, and apparently thought I would eventually come back. Because when my mother and sister went to serve the PPO, he was FURIOUS and ""had no idea"". I had told him I don't know how many times to please leave me alone, we are done, please stop contacting me, etc. He didn't. I blocked him on everything. He filed an appeal for the PPO. I went to the house, and took his journal. Took all the letters to court. Printed out all the harrassing messages he sent to me and my family/friends where he admitted he had hit me. 

He printed off random conversations, took my personal medical records without my consent, about the hospitalization from 2017 trying to claim I wasn't mentally stable enough to break up with him. When I went to the house, to get some of my things, and I knew he wasn't home, a lot of my things were missing. The most alarming of which, was my baby teeth, that were in a family bible. All of my things were displaced, my bike was gone...and I took inventory of everything. 

I destroyed him in court, and got the six month PPO. He admitted to everything. I never brought up the raping. 

During the period that I stayed at my mothers, I was only able to go back to my house twice, because he called the police on me. They sided with him, and said I had to give him ample time to vacate. He had from October of 2017, to April of 2018. I thought that was plenty of time..

Even more of my things were missing when he finally left. I mean my house was empty. He took everything except some of my clothes, my mattress, and I had taken everything of serious personal value to my mothers that I could think of before, so I had my father's things, still. But I was so fucking broken. And he police kept telling me there was nothing I could do, and I was overreacting. He took everything in my shed, too. 

In November of 2018, he took my free biggby drink. I know it was him, because on my BB account he changed everything but the birthday to his information. My friend (same one from ohio/navy) messaged him because she was with me that day, telling him to please leave me alone. He had been making fake facebook accounts to stalk me on social media as well that I just found that day. 

Well, remember meatball? When I buried him in October of 2018, I posted publicly about him mostly so I wouldn't have to explain it more than I had to if anyone asked. It said he was buried behind my shed. In the spring, he was dug up and gone. With my shovel laying on the ground next to the hole and the pile of dirt. Someone took his corpse. 

Is there anything I can do? Anything at all? I am so lost and furious I just want some kind of justice but I have no idea if I have any legal standing. Please, please help me. I can provide any additional information if needed.

Normally it doesn’t phase me, but at the lack of hearing positive words, it builds and becomes more whether than I can bare at times.

&lt;p&gt;Normally it doesn’t phase me, but at the lack of hearing positive words, it builds and becomes more whether than I can bare at times.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck toy for putting me down. You don’t know me, or how hard it’s been to just make it one more day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with Mental Health daily, even on my meds I have momentary weakness, so what gives you the fucking right to be such a pussy ass bitch! Fuck YOU!&lt;/p&gt;

All the money was well spent, as I'm sitting here next to my attorney- across from you and your legal team. You are 20 years older than me and here you are tearing up and crying because of your own actions. And I'm the ""broken one"", right. Ever since we first met and you've bought your way into my heart and mind, I've kept you on this pedestal. Today that pedestal, in my mind, was kicked out from under you. You can't buy people and throw money at them to make them shut up. You can't throw threats of legal repercussions into people's faces. You were brain washing me until today. Everyone worships at your feet, I used to. You receive constant praise, for even walking in a room. No longer getting that from me. People bring up your accomplishments and you fake cry. Pretty nice act for someone on the spectrum. You're sick and no one questions it. This is why you can't even maintain eye contact with anyone. You avoid it while your eyes flicker around the room like a robot. Living in your mind must be interesting, especially when people treat you like a god. Can't even raise your own kids, they're being raised by a nanny. You restrict their lives with the outside world, even their diets. You want them to be like you but they'll be better. You know who they facetime every week? Me. You know who's Twitch streams they watch? Mine. I'm more of a parent than you and they're not even mine. We say we love each other, when's the last time you actually meant that to them? I'm doing you a favor by not saying your name on this. But at some point, when I'm ready to have my life picked apart, I will. You may have fled from your home country, but after this- I hope you go back. If you don't, I will be the one moving. I'll move to New Zealand just to get away from you. I'll change my number and hopefully you'll leave me alone. Any time you come into work, I will always avoid eye contact and interaction. Even in meetings you're leading. You will not get that respect from me. Not letting you play with my mind anymore.

I know what it's like to meet someone who everyone admires and is successful. Everyone wants to be WITH him or BE him. You picked me only because I wasn't even impressed/ fazed by you. I told you how it is and asked you how lonely it gets, being used by everyone. I guess my honesty made you curious. From then on, you emailed, called and texted me. I would chose you over anyone and everyone. Must have been the accent, age and your kids, of which you used to reel me in even more. The first time your true self came out, I tried leaving and you gave me a ring. Then later just found some other girl who wasn't going to ever say no to you. You took her out in public just to get under my skin. And months later after she privately leaked information about you and your address, you started talking to me again. At this point you owned me. I worked for you. I needed that extra income for my Bill's, school and basic living costs. Finally months later I met a nice person on Twitch and later got engaged to him. Dropped you like a hot potato. But he was too nice, suffocated me too much and wanted me to move in with him. I would rather stay in Colorado than move to California and give up my independence. I ended that and allowed you back into my life. I only understand cruel words and then being praised with love &amp; affection after my soul is broken. I know abuse and brain washing because of you. You have told me multiple times that I should be happy you would even be interested in someone like me. Like us common folk should be grateful sick fucks like you even look our way. At our last work event you came into town for a surprise visit. You took on the whole bill, for everyone - at the sushi bar and every bar we went to. All night receiving praise from my coworkers. All the while I'm trying to avoid you and you kept staring at me. Then after drinking too much, like you always do at these things, you hover over my shoulder. Tell me ""It's always been you. You can't keep avoiding me and disappearing."" I say nothing and keep drinking my beer. As you whisper ""Any other girl in this bar would be beyond thrilled to have me whispering in their ear. Here you stand, blatantly shooting me down with a straight face."" I walk away and go to smoke. The rest of the night you keep drinking and drinking. No one says anything to you in regards to your current condition. You then ask me to drive you to your hotel as the bar is closing and everyone is leaving. I agree for some reason. (Too nice and too forgiving). When then get there and I help you into your room. Put into a horribly written poem format. I am no ""writer"". I wrote the stupid poem below about you after you assaulted me. Hope this vague post will let you realize I'm not scared to post any of this and will put your name out there if you keep trying to contact me.


I know what it's like.
I know what it's like to have your mind evacuate your body because of shock. The shock of what's happening and the weight on your body is too heavy you can barely breathe. I know the pain but your mind tunes it out and you start crying. Once you start crying, they pull away surprised. He says ""It's all in your head. Shh. It's all in your head. This isn't bad."" You finally return to your body and start sobbing. They pull away in disgust and this time say ""You're a very broken person."" Once they finally stop and take their weight off, you can breathe again. But not fully. That weight is still there. Sitting on your chest, like one of your cats. They lay down next to you, exhausted. ""Stay and lay with me, or just get out."" Finally realizing what happened, you roll off the bed slowly, in pain, and get dressed. As you walk towards the door with tears streaming down your face, you're in some fucked up way, wishing they would say something else. But they don't. The room is silent. You grab your things and exit. Closing the door behind you, it automatically locks. No keycard. He has it, in there. You go to the elevator, see your reflection in the mirror. Makeup is smudged and hair is a mess. Pull yourself together. But you can't. Tears are still flowing. It's a silent cry. There are other people in the building. You hold it in until you get to the lobby and the valet pulls your car around to the front. Finally able to full volume break down once you are driving away from the place that will always make you shudder if you ever drive by it again. My back was sore, I had bruises on my arms and legs for weeks. It hurt to walk and I went to doctor's the next morning. I didn't sleep at all and will make sure you feel this pain. Any bit of me that used to be capable of intimacy, died that day.

Sometimes we only communicate once a month and other times its longer. It finally occurred to me that maybe we're not as good as friends as we once were and it doesn't help that she hasn't changed much since highschool.

She was boy crazy, only liked trendy/popular things, and naive in high school. She is still all those things. I've slowly grown up, realized that life isn't about the newest technology or being someone you're not. I'm finally ready to make something of myself in this world, and she's just stuck.

I was the independent one in our dynamic. I've never relied on people to get something done or to have a good time, but she was the opposite. She's actually so codependent now on her boyfriend and it sickens me a little. They recently had a baby and her boyfriend works 12 plus hours as a barber to make ends meet. She constantly tells me that she is struggling, but upon getting her tax refund back, instead of paying her credit card bills and school loans, she bought a new iphone, 180 dollar shoes, and recently threw a marvel themed birthday part for 50 guests where she paid for everything. She knows how much her boyfriend slaves to provide food, but won't get a job. Babysitting isn't an issue either since she told me that her boyfriend's mother has offered to watch her, free of charge. She was a talented makeup artist, but threw it all away when she met her boyfriend. It's getting to the point that anything she does repulses me a little.

And i think she knows it.

It's gotten so bad that I don't even wanna be her friend anymore. How could you just stand by and watch someone work so hard and not want to return the favor?

Narcissist, selfish and emotionally unstable. Our relationship goes back about 6 years, I would deal with her crying about everything everyday we worked together. Then she moved across the country and I still became her phone therapist. Sitting on the phone for hours while she complained, cried, etc. I thought this was normal. I would get massive anxiety when it was time to talk with her and I know it's from the years of having one sided, emotional conversations with her. I just knew that the next 2 hours of my life were going to be this. Anyways.

I've been going through a lot since January. My mom had a heart attack (she survived thankfully!!) and I've been diagnosed with Graves Disease and been very depressed due to the whole thing. The day my mom had a heart attack I messaged my friend (I dont deal well with phone conversations so I usually keep a lot of my communication through text if I can help it) she was the first person I told and all she messaged back was ""i hope shes ok, sending my love"". Now keep in mind I have had the diagnosis of Graves disease since then, battling depression and crippling anxiety due to it so I've been struggling to say the least. It took this friend 6 weeks, 6 WEEKS to check in on me and see how my mom was doing. Now this friend didn't know yet about my diagnosis so I take this time to tell her via text (I hate the phone. I'm not going to apologize for texting) She asks how I'm doing so I say ""not so good. Things have been rough, found out I have Graves disease and I've been a ball of depression since""... she ghosted me for a week after I sent that! A week with dead air. No reply, no nothing. 

Now shes a teacher and I jsut assumed she was on a trip to New York with her hair school so I let it slide. Fast forward to last week where we finally get to talk on the phone, she doesnt ask me once how I am, ignoring the last text until I bring it up. I told her I'm not mad, just upset but i understand that she was busy.... turns out she wasnt in new york or was she busy. She literally ghosted me in my time of need. Then had the audacity to blame me when I called her out on it. ""You should have told me what was going on"" Dude, I'm depressed. I'm not just gonna call u and be like ""hey I'm depressed. K. Bye"" that's not how it works. She was screaming at me on the phone because shes never wrong and never apologized once when I asked her why it took 6 weeks to check in on me after my moms heart attack so I called her selfish and eventually hung up on her. She then texted me telling me how low it is that I would call her selfish and blame her for her actions. ""I'm sorry you feel this way, however"" were her legit words. 

I'm done. I'm officially walking away. I've sat by her for years holding her hand and comforting her in regards to her mothers MS (multiple sclerosis) and this so called ""friend"" cant even be there for me?? To say ""sending my love"" after my moms heart attack and leaving me high and dry for 6 weeks while I deal with the aftermath is pretty effing cold, I'm not putting myself through this one sided narcissistic relationship any longer.

I wasn't sure how to take in this information, so I took it as a ""this is why I don't communicate with the mom as much anymore"", which I get.

I’m trying to right my wrongs and reassemble and hold my family together that i have broken these past months.

I met my ex when i was in 10th grade we’re both 26 now with a 6 year old son and have gone through the ups and the downs of life. About 2 years ago we broke up cause I felt drained by all the fighting we had been doing and I was emotionally exhausted with the things we had went through. I went seeking comfort through a friend of ours who was good friends with my ex and i felt like she was the only one that would hear me out and it felt good to be listened too and valued this girl was also the ex girlfriend of my best friend and my exes brother so i had known her for years. I had no intention of getting involved romantically with this girl but we both started developing feelings for each other and i let things that never should have happen, happen. I went to texas from maryland to visit her and was visiting my family and as we were alone i was somewhat enjoying it but always thinking about of my ex and my son and the family that i was breaking but it felt good with someone i could connect with and see my self with and a life with my ex found out what was going on cause she asked and i had no reason to lie to her and she started screaming and yelling and my heart instantly dropped and was broken with feeling i didn’t know were there so toward the end of this visit i told this girl that it wasn’t going to happen and when i got back to maryland my ex picked up me and my son and my heart was in shattered i was wondering would she take me back with these feelings i didn’t know i had can we be a family can we finally get along? I had no clue and we started trying again and her and my son moved into my apartment so we were trying to reassemble this family and be happy and for some reason i let my self start checking up on this girl i was talking to before and i told my not really gf that she was just my friend  and that i missed talking to her so i knew she wasn’t okay with it but i was so too me at the time that’s all that mattered i was being selfish and in the back of my mind giving up then i got connected again and time went by and i started having anger to towards my gf cause i thought she was preventing  a relationship that i could be happy with disregarding her happiness and my sons with was hands down the biggest mistake up my life by far.
So my we split up yet again with me being a total asshole telling her to get out of my apartment i don’t love you full well knowing i did. so she took our son and left and this same girl i was talking to all those months ago flew up and i have no idea why because my ex was on my mind the whole time. This girl that flew up i told her i loved her was just to make her feel good but something was missing the whole time and i felt empty. During the visit my ex was very jealous which was only natural because someone was sleeping next to her man for a week and my son was in tears every night wondering where his dad was and i was thinking of them the whole time. One night during the visit my ex called and said come see me and our son now if you care even in the slightest and i dropped what i was doing and drove to where they were and we went back and left the girl that was visiting to see me for 4 hours alone at my place.  I left every night that week to see my ex and my son but only telling my ex to move back in when this girl left. So after she left they moved backing and i really loved it i was having the best time just living my life we were all happy and content in our lives but after threw months and one fight i relapsed and wa swondering how this girl was doing and started talking again and hurting my gf all over again when i should have blocked her and deleted her number. So she moved my son and herself out again in february after i told her it wasn’t working but at that point i had stopped talking to that other girl again and i was just alone every night missing them wondering what the fuck i was doing getting drunk wanting to end my life hating this cycle i started that was hurting my family and this last time i stopped talking to this girl i blocked her deleted her number and told her that this friendship or whatever it was, was the biggest mistake of my life. So i downloaded tinder and bumble to try to match with my ex and so see if we could start flirting and being ok and see where it lead and it was going well in my head we matched and we were flirting and i didn’t know she had met a guy that made her feel the same as the girl i was once talking to. So we’ve come full circle. She said she had a date this weekend and if i could watch out son and i said of course and i figured out that night i had lost my family and lost the girl of my dreams feeling the same things that i put her through. Heart break and jealously hatred for myself and how disgusting i had been all this time and all it took was a taste of my own medicine. So when she came to pick up our son the next day i begged her that i would end the cycle and we could get married if she came back and was crying my eyes out. She said she needed time and she took our son and left she had every right too with everything that i had put her through  she needed to be sure i was being honest and true so a a couple days went by and she said she didn’t believe me and i was getting no where i couldn’t eat i couldn’t sleep i was shaky i was getting a max of three outs of sleep so her still caring for me told her to come stay at her parents house and i was all for it i was hoping for anyway i could to tell her i loved her and how much i cared so i stayed that whole week and i said on saturday if she wanted to go out that night and i would take her out to a nice diner and we would go out drinking that night as well. So i worked that we were supposed to go out and as i was working she was talking to this new guy and breaking up with him for reasons that i could only imagine were keeping us together for our son and we went out that night and she told me that and my heart was glowing and i was happy to finally have my family back and i knew i could not fuck this up again. That guy said his goodbyes that night and she said hers and we went along with the week after with her saying that she was talking to him as a friend and i was nervous but things were going great we were doing things as a family and i was really cherishing my family. But the more they talked the more i could feel herself distancing herself from me and i felt it and got drunk one night after work and took two steps back from the progress that we were making. So to her that meant that i wasn’t goin got give it my all and the two days after that she didn’t hug or kiss me when i got home and when we started to go to sleep she was not on my like normal and we went to bed and i had a nightmare about the two of them and something felt off so i got up and snooped in her ipad that was connected to her phone which i had no right to do and say that they were sexting that night and i started crying and tossed the ipad on the bed she woke up and got mad and she didn’t feel bad and why should she? I fucked this family up and her mind was nowhere near it was. she said she needed space and was going to stay at her moms that night on friday and i was crying an just started getting ready for work and told her okay and that i was sort and i had such remotest for what i had done i was just hurt and confused. I know what it’s like to talk to someone you think is (the one) someone you can see yourself with. So i called her while at work and things went wrong i had broken down and my work truck and was telling her i needed to talk and i could stop sobbing and it was too much and she said that she needed and week apart and her and my son were going to go back and move out and i told her and begged her no i told her i’m going to fight for this family i can’t give up i can’t fail you guys again and i can’t fail myself. but i agreed to the week and that night actually this past friday march 29th 2019 she said she was going out as a friend and i already knew what was going to happen they had a night out and they did there business. when she go back that morning poured my heart and soul in this huge page long note trying to right my wrongs i’ve made for us because that night out son was crying to me wondering where mommy was and it tore me to pieces that’s what she went through when i was doing that to her but both times we’re doing these things the one person that’s suffered the most was and is our son and i’m on a flight to texas right now to be with my family trying to hold my heart and my head together with no intention other than getting better for the bith of them so i can be the best i can be. Before I left we talked and i told her that i loved her that that i know she didn’t feel the same way but she was going to stay at my place while i was gone. She was very upset and mad when i told her i was going to get a ticket i knew she thought i was giving up and going back to that girl but i have no intention of either of those i just need to show her i can change and be the best person for this family cause the pain i feel and have in my heart and souls are crushing me but it’s making me a better man for the first time in my life i know what i need to do and i know i can make us a happy family she said this week she would not be comunicsting with this out guy as well, now is that true? I can only hope so other wise i feel as if i have no chance when i left today it was on a good note she wished me safe travels and i told her that i was not giving up ever cause to give up on this family is to give up on our son and i. don’t fail him again his little heart can’t take it she need to get rid of that guy and i’m sure he’s nice but as long as she’s talking to him me and our son will suffer just she they both did while i was doing it...so the tables turned and here we are this next week will mean the life or death of our family and i have to be optimistic and pray and hope that i get this chance to prove to her i’m a changed man and that my heart only beats for her. I know i seem like a shitty guy and i don’t like to think i am i have so much regret in my life but i still have to try to right my wrongs. And try for my family it’s worth fighting for as along as it takes i out her through hell and back and i have to make that journey for her to show her as well i supposed so wish my family luck or tell me to fuck off but it feels good to get this out and try to be a better man because of my mistakes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect this to get a read and I don’t expect people to show interest. I’m trying to right my wrongs and reassemble and hold my family together that i have broken these past months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met my ex when i was in 10th grade we’re both 26 now with a 6 year old son and have gone through the ups and the downs of life. About 2 years ago we broke up cause I felt drained by all the fighting we had been doing and I was emotionally exhausted with the things we had went through. I went seeking comfort through a friend of ours who was good friends with my ex and i felt like she was the only one that would hear me out and it felt good to be listened too and valued this girl was also the ex girlfriend of my best friend and my exes brother so i had known her for years. I had no intention of getting involved romantically with this girl but we both started developing feelings for each other and i let things that never should have happen, happen. I went to texas from maryland to visit her and was visiting my family and as we were alone i was somewhat enjoying it but always thinking about of my ex and my son and the family that i was breaking but it felt good with someone i could connect with and see my self with and a life with my ex found out what was going on cause she asked and i had no reason to lie to her and she started screaming and yelling and my heart instantly dropped and was broken with feeling i didn’t know were there so toward the end of this visit i told this girl that it wasn’t going to happen and when i got back to maryland my ex picked up me and my son and my heart was in shattered i was wondering would she take me back with these feelings i didn’t know i had can we be a family can we finally get along? I had no clue and we started trying again and her and my son moved into my apartment so we were trying to reassemble this family and be happy and for some reason i let my self start checking up on this girl i was talking to before and i told my not really gf that she was just my friend  and that i missed talking to her so i knew she wasn’t okay with it but i was so too me at the time that’s all that mattered i was being selfish and in the back of my mind giving up then i got connected again and time went by and i started having anger to towards my gf cause i thought she was preventing  a relationship that i could be happy with disregarding her happiness and my sons with was hands down the biggest mistake up my life by far.
So my we split up yet again with me being a total asshole telling her to get out of my apartment i don’t love you full well knowing i did. so she took our son and left and this same girl i was talking to all those months ago flew up and i have no idea why because my ex was on my mind the whole time. This girl that flew up i told her i loved her was just to make her feel good but something was missing the whole time and i felt empty. During the visit my ex was very jealous which was only natural because someone was sleeping next to her man for a week and my son was in tears every night wondering where his dad was and i was thinking of them the whole time. One night during the visit my ex called and said come see me and our son now if you care even in the slightest and i dropped what i was doing and drove to where they were and we went back and left the girl that was visiting to see me for 4 hours alone at my place.  I left every night that week to see my ex and my son but only telling my ex to move back in when this girl left. So after she left they moved backing and i really loved it i was having the best time just living my life we were all happy and content in our lives but after threw months and one fight i relapsed and wa swondering how this girl was doing and started talking again and hurting my gf all over again when i should have blocked her and deleted her number. So she moved my son and herself out again in february after i told her it wasn’t working but at that point i had stopped talking to that other girl again and i was just alone every night missing them wondering what the fuck i was doing getting drunk wanting to end my life hating this cycle i started that was hurting my family and this last time i stopped talking to this girl i blocked her deleted her number and told her that this friendship or whatever it was, was the biggest mistake of my life. So i downloaded tinder and bumble to try to match with my ex and so see if we could start flirting and being ok and see where it lead and it was going well in my head we matched and we were flirting and i didn’t know she had met a guy that made her feel the same as the girl i was once talking to.

Ex accused me of trying to cheat with his high school friend who I texted occasionally. All we ever did was send memes back and forth, but regardless I wasn't trying to cheat. I actually just thought he was a cool guy, and one of my ex's few friends I could get along with.

Before, my ex had accused me of having a soft spot for this friend and even ""siding"" with this friend over my ex in the most mundane of things. He was always annoyed that I was happy for opportunities to hang out with this guy and that I never wanted to hang out with his closest friend. The reason why? His best friend is racist, antisemitic, and an alcoholic. I'm Jewish. Multiple times he has gotten belligerently drunk with us and gone on tirades. One escalated to the point that he started attacking me. There is very little reason for me to like this guy and being around him puts me on edge and sick to my stomach with apprehension.

So here's a list of my ex's closest friends that I've been able to meet:

1. BFF alcoholic bigot
2. Dude I texted with, goes to school and is an all around normal and cool guy. Also cut off the BFF friend for his asshole ways for about a year, so at least I knew he didn't secretly despise me for my freaking ethnicity. Actually made an effort to include me in hangouts with all of ex's friends, talked to me as if I wasn't another temporary gf.
3. Welder friend who is cool, I enjoy hanging out with, but is elusive and didn't seem that interested in talking with me outside of hangouts. Nearly impossible to get in touch with anyways.
4. Now excommunicated friend who was just as, if not worse than #1 on top of being unhinged. Also went on an antisemitic tirade against ex and me.
5. Another excommunicated friend who had a psychotic break and threatened to rape my drunk, passed out self within knowing me one day.

Gee, what a lovely bunch. Wonder why I would ever prefer this guy over the others.

I wanted to be on good terms with my ex's friends. I never wanted him to feel like we were incompatible parts of his life. So even though that fell through with #1 (and he still demanded to bring him around anyway), I thought I could make it work for #2 at the very least. I just wanted to be liked by ex's closest friends, not treated as a disposable gf. Or at least thought of as human.

So it stings he had all of this information, all of the distress I've been through bc of his other friends, and still decided that the only reason I would cling to this guy was because I wanted to be with him. He could never believe I was actually on his side, could he? After 3 1/2 years.

And after we've established I'm not cheating, he wants to hammer it home how much he resents that I like this guy. So he tells me deeply personal and private things about *his friend* in the hopes of what? Squashing any attraction I had for this guy??? Like I feel bad about how fucking spiteful and retaliatory my ex is that he would divulge such information about somebody else just to hurt me, wtf. My own spite wants to tell his friend that but since it *is* out of spite, I really don't think I should. But jfc who does that?

I'm about to turn 18 in less than a month (late April). For around a year now my therapist and I have been talking about the possibility of me moving out to leave my abusive mother. The abuse has been getting worse lately, and so has my mental state. At this point I want to leave as soon as possible.

We have three wonderful cats. An almost 8 year old I had since I was 10, a 6 year old who's like his little sister and the softest and most gentle cat I ever had. A one year old cat named Findus (have a few pics of him on my account). 

Findus is a huge Neva Masquerade/British Shorthair mix with long beige/brown fur and piercing blue eyes. My mom got him as a birthday present in late '17. He doesn't get along with our two other cats, although he's the kindest and softest soul. Although he's the largest and strongest out of our cats, he doesn't do anything but lightly touch the others when they beat him up. He's not afraid of them though, nor is he scared of guests or the vacuum. He likes to lay on the couch with me and put his paw on my shoulder. 

What I'm saying is: I really love this cat with all my heart

And so does mom. I wouldn't be surprised if he was her favourite. I haven't talked to her about moving out yet, but I did ask if I could keep one of the cats if I moved out one day. She said I could keep our girl, since she doesn't really like her as much. She is attached to our oldest though, so I don't have the heart to separate them. Findus, as I said, doesn't get along with any of them though. It would be beneficial for both of us if I took him with me. I asked mom if she would sell him to me for 500€ but she said 'absolutely not'.

I honestly don't think she deserves him. This is the woman who beat me since I was around 4, threw a chair at me when I was 5, called me her biggest mistake so many times and so many more things. She doesn't deserve any of our cats. I'm afraid of being alone when I move out, I just want to keep my baby.


I know I'm overreacting, the situation just kinda hit me and it makes me want to stay here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;English isn&amp;#39;t my first language, my apologies for any errors.&lt;/p&gt;

My mother,46 years old, for the past 3 months has went to the hospital  and been admitted to the intensie care unit for, think carbon dioxide poison an upwards up 7-8 times.

They would usually keep her a week, then send her home after seeing some improvement.

She is in the end stages of COPD, has A1AT, and emphysema.

They were hooking her up to a non-intrusive ventilator ( a bipap). This machine helps get the carbon dioxide built up in her lungs out.

This week they decided to finally get a bipap machine sent to our house, but she would have to stay at the hospital till it arrived.

Today we get a message through my grandmother that my mom was put back into ICU after she was put into a normal room.

We assume its the usual, until I walk in to find my mom with a tube down her throat. I am a strong person, and I usually can handle graphic scenes or emotional stuff, but I broke.

8 visits to the hospital in 3 months and then they decide its time to order a bipap. By the time her carbon dioxide build up was getting too high for a bipap.

So now I am sitting in a room watching my mother lay in a bed, in the same hospital that has sent her home 8 times after very very minimal improvement.


I am so distraught, have no idea how to feel, or what to think. 

The doctors still have told me nothing. How long she has to stay on it. Is it permanent. Whats her chances of survival. Etc etc.

I am lost.

Edit: copy and pasted from below:
"" After being there for 3 hours, I brought up to someone doing a blood gas that no one has told us anything. Turns out to get the CO2 out, she needed to be put on an invasive ventilator, and knocked out for 24 hours. Tomorrow they will wake her up and see if she can breathe on a bipap machine and keep her CO2 down. Her CO2 was good when I left, but she was still knocked out. 

_------------

This whole situation was not as severe as it seemed, the doctors just assumed we knew what was going on.

Once she is breathing okay, she will come home and have to be on a bipap 24/7 basically. Luckily our insurance covers the machine.

Just sucked being scared to death for all that time. They used to tell my mother if she ever had something like a collapsed lung/or similar that on a ventilator she would not be able to recover- this however was not the case.

I am very livid with the hospital for not getting my mother a bipap the past 8 times we have been there for this issue.

My shy friend who likes to talk about how to “kill” people and anything else random (note she wouldn’t actually hurt anyone) the friend who is crazy once she opens up to you and is the goofball that everyone loves. The “nerd” who likes anything about space and memes. 
    Then there’s me, the one who’s also shy, crazy and loud. The one you least expect to be hiding anything behind my smile and laugh everyday. The one who loves to make you smile and forget your trouble while trying to hid my own demons trapped away until I can’t distract myself with my fiends, videos or music. The one who hates the silence because that’s when my thoughts, my demons come back and haunt me. 
       Yes, I know I’m not the only one and there’s plenty of people like me.. but that doesn’t truly help. I wanted to write this to help others who have friends like me. Did a certain friend pop into your mind while reading this? Check on them please, this could help them. Now I’m not saying I never hid my feelings I have broke down In front of them before many times, I mean they never truly talk about their feelings when it’s just you and them, they never talk about (almost)nothing seriously. They always scoff it off and try to change the subject if it gets to touchy. I have been through some messed up shit while growing up that I never want to be brought back to my life or mind so I block it out the best I can, so why should my friends know about this? So they can pity me? Worry about me? I just can’t... I’m not trying to sound like I’m trying to get attention, trust me the only reason I’m writing this is to vent, get these feelings out before I burst out. Im just trying to get the word out that there’s people just like me maybe worse going through this and I don’t want them to be alone like me. Please reach out to your friends even the ones you’d least expect to be upset and troubled. They probably need you, that’s the second reason I am writing this to help others. 

  To be honest I don’t even know I’m going to post this or to where.. I just wanted to vent and let it out. If you’ve read this thanks for your time.

I’ve blocked and deleted Ed number from my phone, I don’t want to come out about this due to how I could be seen as the one at fault for sending them when she emotionally manipulated me, of course she sent her own pics, and I never saved them, but just... god I can’t believe she’s someone that could just live every day knowing they could fuck over someone with a single NSFW pic...

I really needed to get this off my chest","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok... so I’m just really mad rn, I had dated this girl for almost a year I think about 9-10 months... we broke up when someone else had asked me out, she was indifferent, I thought it was just because the spark was gone due to her family going through a divorce, but last night my friend Darwin (online name) had told me that they had broken up after about a month, he was surprised I could deal with her that long, the reason why she broke up is that she admitted to making me feel horrible so she could get pics off of me (btw, I’m 17 and she is 16 I have no clue if this is illegal or not) and she had asked Darwin if he wanted to see my pics, pics I had taken and deleted immediately after, I trusted her to not save them, but of course she did, she’s manipulated me and Darwin, darwin was atleast head strong enough only to send her a picture of his face, and he trusted her as well because he protects his anonymity, he hates people seeing his face and he’s only shown me his face once, but the fact that she tried to do this shit to us... I’ve blocked and deleted Ed number from my phone, I don’t want to come out about this due to how I could be seen as the one at fault for sending them when she emotionally manipulated me, of course she sent her own pics, and I never saved them, but just... god I can’t believe she’s someone that could just live every day knowing they could fuck over someone with a single NSFW pic... I’m a fuckin idiot...

Buckle up, you're in for a real one.

So there would be this group of bullies back in my ghetto-ass elementary school. These dumbasses would tease me for stuff that didn't even make sense. I'd just be like, ""Dafuq?""

I don't know who's dumber, though; them or my classmates. they would actually see me get harassed, no one would do anything, they would just stare. But let me tell you something about bullying. When every single person actually gets in on the harassment towards me and only me, and exclude me from everything, then would you expect me to be fucking happy? I even got depression and anxiety for that. But everyone would still ask, ""Dan, why are you always angry?""

I literally went up to one of my classmates and said, ""Name one reason why everyone hates me.""

He replied, ""Well, you're always mad.""

So, I just asked him a simple question: ""Why do you think I'm always mad?""

He took a second to detox himself from the shit everyone else fed his brain. ""Oh, yeah. Okay, never mind. I can't think of a reason.""

You'd think that the story would end there, but hell nah.

Somehow, the main bully of the group who even thought of the idea of: ""Hey, let's bully Dan,"" is highly respected, but I don't know how. He's an asshole and he's so stupid. He watches porn and plays on his PS4 instead of doing homework. One time, someone asked him what his favorite food was that started with a vowel. He legit said: ""What's a vowel?""

Well, anyways, graduation party day. Hooray, except I'm alone because no one likes me, except the teachers and principal. Yaay...

So we're all wearing our fancy-ass suits and the main bully is pointing at people, telling them how his mom thinks of them.

""Emiliano, my mom thinks your a good friend. Noah, my mom thinks you're cool."" I don't give a shit. As long as he doesn't say another twisted thing about me, I'm good. Until he gets to me. Out of nowhere, he goes: ""And Dan, my mom thinks you're a psycho. You always cuss at me and hit yourself and bang your head on the walls.""

First off, look who's talking. He literally cusses the MOST at my school. Second, now you're going to feed your mom twisted shit about me.

So, I'm pretty ready to talk to this motherfucker about going around, loosely telling people I'm a sociopath. But he just ignores me. It doesn't take long to notice he's doing it on purpose. Because I'm literally yelling my valid arguments at him and he was just walking around, like a deaf person.

So I made an inference. For his mom to think I'm like that, she must not know we HE did. So he's running to his mommy, whining about how he's been such a little angel and I'm just running up to him cussing and screaming and destroying myself.

By the way, the only reason I do such things to myself is because I can't do it to anyone else. But if I could, I'm bang that bitch's head on a concrete wall. And when he crawls on the ground like the crippled piece of shit he is, I'd grab a knife and slice off his limbs. Then I would kick and stomp him. Finally, I'd light him on fire to rot.

By the way, this is an actual story. I moved districts to avoid this shit. I'm 13. This happened a year ago. But let me tell you one thing:

Happy endings don't fucking exist.

Okay, so, my dad’s fucking insane. He’s a sociopathic, paranoid sack of shit. Having pulled back some layers of memory, I believe I’ve found enough dirt on him to write a fucking research paper.

For one thing, he completely fucked me over in my adolescence. Most parents instill rationality and understanding in their kids. My dad? No, physical assault was his go-to whenever I broke a rule. Most kids learned “oh, I shouldn’t do this because of x.” I learned “oh, I shouldn’t do this because if I do, I get hit with a clenched fist.”

Secondly, he’s made me the kind of person with whom people are friends only because they think I’m going to bust into school with a P226 and a .45, and not because of my personality. I have four friends. Four fucking friends. I met three of them this year, and the fourth is more of an acquaintance than a friend. I was never taught how to behave around people. I was never taught empathy. Instead, I was taught that there were B-2 bombers flying over us at every moment. I was taught that the Clintons would kill me if I became popular. I was taught that every successful person in the world was getting Jewish shekels at Illuminati sex parties. You know how fucked up that sounds to a bunch of first graders who can’t even write in English yet? It fucked me over entirely and robbed me of any shred of hope that I might have friends.

Third, he has no regard for others, a value which he has thoroughly planted in my mind. He talks about the Challenger exploding as though it was an expensive firework. He talks about 9/11 as though it’s a daily occurrence. For fuck’s sake, he cheered “fuck yeah!” as he watched the Christchurch footage. Life, to him, is simply a resource, like gas or steel. It took most of my adolescence to realize how fucked up that is, but I was always taught that. 

Fourth, he taught me to embrace hypocrisy. He tells me not to play video games (what a radical fucking idea there, dad) and to focus on school, despite the fact that he plays Civilization for most of his waking hours and has shown me a report card of his from 11th grade with an F- in English. He is incapable of leading by example because he’s a ware of flesh.

Fifth and finally, he’s just a shitty person. He’s had two jobs every year for the past five years, he’s told me that I’m his least favorite child, and he generally treats me like shit. Now, I will say that the beatings have stopped, but psychological torment is no better. Oftentimes, it’s unintentional (such as making fun of gays despite the fact that I’m gay, but still closeted), but more often, it’s outright. Scolding me for being weak and thin. Mocking me for being introverted. Spending time with my siblings with no invitation.

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not even talking about things that are off color, literally all I asked was, &amp;quot;Got any hobbies? I love reading and gaming!&amp;quot;
I feel very annoyed and singled out by my manager. Like, excuse me for being fucking nice?&lt;/p&gt;

She didn’t like me back, she was really mean and she blocked me.

I live in a 3rd world country by the way. I moved here nearly 4 years ago because it's my parent's home country and they were facing issues in the states that caused me to come here.

Anyway, the fact this girl blocked me for no reason made me really sad, so one time I was talking to my friend on a discord server and he we started talking about a guy that I don’t even know, a guy who supposedly liked her too, and was from another school.

As a joke I made a meme of Goku ultra instinct punching Jiren in the gut and I wrote “Me” on Goku and the other dude’s name on Jiren. Now, we’re usually really edgy so that’s why I did it. I was only doing it as a joke. Then my friend proceeds to send that guy the fucking meme AND my phone number. And then he hung up.

The next day I get home from school and this random guy I’m talking about starts telling me stuff like “Hey, aren’t you ashamed of making stupid shit like that? By the way, I’m the guy you want. And anything you can say you can say it to my face not making stupid memes. Now she’s mad with you for doing stupid shit.”

So I had a conversation with the guy, he was acting really passive aggressive, giving me advice, saying “Well, if she hates you it’s you’re fault. Just don’t make jokes like that because even if you’re kidding someone could beat you up.” Telling me to go back to my nap and stuff. He really made me angry, so when we stopped talking I didn’t give a fuck and made more fun of this even after I apologized to the girl at my school over the meme the next day.

4 months passed, it was February. I was angry at my friend and even to to this day he doesn’t give a shit. I had been lightly making jokes about this and memes and then the guy texts me again, this time extremely aggressive.

He said that if I made another meme about him that I was going to die. He said that I had no idea what was going to happen if I kept making jokes and that even if they were just jokes he didn’t care because he doesn’t know me, and he blocked me.

I’ve been really pissed off ever since and I’ve been looking for ways to deal with it. I don’t care much about the fact that my ex-crush doesn’t like me anymore, but more about the fact that my friend, my ex-crush and him were just being absolute dicks to me for something so small.

I had another friend who’s also friend’s with my friend who pranked the guy. He got a bunch of people we know through his WhatsApp and told him to not get involved with us. But I legit deadass want to teach that guy a lesson. My friend’s are telling me that it’s ok to joke about this because he supposedly isn’t going to do anything, but if he comes back then we can roast him. He really REALLY pissed me off and I want to say a couple of things to him. But since my friends are telling me that I shouldn’t, I’m stuck with just me not being able to do anything. And it’s honestly a lot of pressure, because one of the only friends I have betrayed me, did a complete 180 and went back on his words of “I won’t say anything.” And is now suddenly defending this other random guy, and he doesn’t give a damn about him sending the jokes I made over to him, the guy treated me like I was stupid and I want to do something about it, and I’m also angry because this ex-crush of mine talked behind my back, blocked me and used me for English projects even before this whole thing even started. I don’t know what to do.

P.S. Everyone involved in this story other than the guy who threatened me is from my old school. I’m in a new school now, and this ex-crush I used to like transferred over with me. She seems really pissed off. Sucks.﻿ I'm 15 by the way, in 10th grade.

By the way, I’m the guy you want. And anything you can say you can say it to my face not making stupid memes. Now she’s mad with you for doing stupid shit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a conversation with the guy, he was acting really passive aggressive, giving me advice, saying “Well, if she hates you it’s you’re fault. Just don’t make jokes like that because even if you’re kidding someone could beat you up.” Telling me to go back to my nap and stuff. He really made me angry, so when we stopped talking I didn’t give a fuck and made more fun of this even after I apologized to the girl at my school over the meme the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 months passed, it was February. I was angry at my friend and even to to this day he doesn’t give a shit. I had been lightly making jokes about this and memes and then the guy texts me again, this time extremely aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that if I made another meme about him that I was going to die. He said that I had no idea what was going to happen if I kept making jokes and that even if they were just jokes he didn’t care because he doesn’t know me, and he blocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been really pissed off ever since and I’ve been looking for ways to deal with it. I don’t care much about the fact that my ex-crush doesn’t like me anymore, but more about the fact that my friend, my ex-crush and him were just being absolute dicks to me for something so small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another friend who’s also friend’s with my friend who pranked the guy. He got a bunch of people we know through his WhatsApp and told him to not get involved with us. But I legit deadass want to teach that guy a lesson. My friend’s are telling me that it’s ok to joke about this because he supposedly isn’t going to do anything, but if he comes back then we can roast him. He really REALLY pissed me off and I want to say a couple of things to him. But since my friends are telling me that I shouldn’t, I’m stuck with just me not being able to do anything. And it’s honestly a lot of pressure, because one of the only friends I have betrayed me, did a complete 180 and went back on his words of “I won’t say anything.” And is now suddenly defending this other random guy, and he doesn’t give a damn about him sending the jokes I made over to him, the guy treated me like I was stupid and I want to do something about it, and I’m also angry because this ex-crush of mine talked behind my back, blocked me and used me for English projects even before this whole thing even started. I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Everyone involved in this story other than the guy who threatened me is from my old school. I’m in a new school now, and this ex-crush I used to like transferred over with me. She seems really pissed off. Sucks.﻿ I&amp;#39;m 15 by the way, in 10th grade.&lt;/p&gt;

Also I realize that Reddit or writing in general is not the best medium to paint a full picture so this is definitely gonna be a long winded one, as I will do my best to describe all relevant details, so hang on there is much I want to say. Here we go!

# Lifestyle

I am about to turn 28, male, Mid-Level Software Engineer located in Puerto Rico. I have a well paying job that I enjoy very much and consumes about 5 hours per week of my time with a decent competitive pay, for my location, of $63k a year (this is not as relevant unless you are into financial independence like me). I work out, swim, for an hour 3 times a week. I enjoy very much cooking and shopping for groceries, and do meal preps for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a hard time engaging with people, at times I become recluse and although not always it is painful to be lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

On my spare time I read about software and tech, watch a bunch of movies/series, and the internet hence Reddit ^(hi there). 

# Personality

My form of expression is most times very direct, blunt, and rude (which I have been working on for a long time. I think this is most because I am incredibly rational and have a tendency to think things through and digest them easily. Sometimes I spend whole weekends in silence passing the time, without really carrying out a conversation.   


When having conversations I tend to lean towards philosophy in the sense that I really dig into the topic and deconstruct it to present an argument, somewhat like a debate which also might not be a good thing. I really much enjoy this thought process as it gives much a sense of satisfaction to familiarize myself with the core of the discussion/issue.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I really care for people and those around me but in a very cynical, disappointed kind of way. I just wish people will be more driven.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I find myself to be greedy. I want to amount wealth, pursuing financial independence as a goal and some of the interest I currently follow are driven by interests in money. Frugality and exploring alternative sources of income are the currently most present, although being cheap and not going out much might land on ""ironic but true"".

&amp;#x200B;

Other words that describe me: cynic, stoic, calculating, erratic, sarcastic, condescending, disorganized, level-headed

# Social Life

There are a few friends from college I keep up with and although unorthodox I am by no means socially impaired aside from disliking small talk *&lt;insert irony&gt;*. Most times I just feel disliked and ignored by those around me, and I also lack enthusiasm to partake with those around me as I feel that the culture does not resonate with my personality very well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two of my closest friends live in the States, my roommate is someone I trust and am close to but have very different lifestyles, the rest I would put as acquaintances and a handful of not so close friends, some also abroad, which I don't hang out with on the regular if there is even such a thing in my situation.I work for a 10 person startup, and I feel that this is a huge loss of potential opportunities but it cannot be helped.  


Incoming cliches of social anxiety: Overall I don't receive calls/texts from people, never have I been asked to ""just meet up and catch up"", and infrequently get asked to hang out. I am aware that I give the wrong vibe to people because my brain defaults to ""there are better things to do with your time"", but to those I do get asked I ALWAYS attend.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the small but thriving startup community here, there are recurring events that I attend to from time to time but never seem to connect with people in the sense of making new friends.

# Hobbies

For many years gaming was my outlet for social interaction, I had already invested in my desktop computer. I made quite a few online acquaintances, most just casual gamers like me. It also meant I did not have to spend money at all to enjoy my free time.

&amp;#x200B;

Coding is certainly a great skill and passion of mine, although not very social. I am still exploring ways to make this more engaging for me in social aspects since I find it hard to converse about it, it's not a great topic of conversation for those who are not familiarized.

&amp;#x200B;

Cooking, I don't just cook to provide myself sustenance, I thoroughly enjoy the process and the creativity I can express through it. Certainly not a home cook Master Chef type of person, yet...

&amp;#x200B;

Cycling, a bad knee has caused me to refrain from it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't count, social media, the internet as a whole, or movies/series as hobbies. Those are mostly pass-times, nothing of substance just put brain on neutral and zone out.

# Struggles

In Puerto Rico there are a few things to do regular things which I find to not enjoy as much that limit my social potential. There are many restaurants, some quite a few bars that host live events, one or two Comicons a year. These are the ones most prevalent, and none of which I enjoy enough to want to engage in.  


I have been thinking of finding another job, moving to the US (am a citizen), exploring other cultures where it may be easy to travel to. What holds me back is the cost, the fear that the problem is me and my attitude. I also own a condo I have recently bought although I believe it to be easily rentable if needed or other alternatives.  


I don't feel like people around me are inviting and/or that my interest are not aligned with those of other Puerto Ricans. I am frugal, highly intellectual, driven and methodical in thought, none of those I would describe as the average person in the island.

&amp;#x200B;

When learning things about coding, I get unmotivated very quickly. I think this is because of oversaturation due to my job. Doing it day in and day out makes me struggle when I try to learn more stuff, although I'd like to think that an interesting project might be a good motivator but nothing comes to mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit, I&amp;#39;d like to share my journey and current situation with all of you in hopes I find some clarity and may be able to help others in a similar situation, initially thought of posting this on &lt;a href=""/r/socialskills""&gt;r/socialskills&lt;/a&gt; but thought better of it as it became quite extensive.

Today was a day of everything that makes a regret possible.  A worry that willl plauge you.. And a fear of fate..

Its a heavy weight i wont lie..im not even sure about the "" whatt if… my mind is threatened by the ""what now?""\

Im sorry if it hurt… i was angry
Im sorry that i was angry… but i was hurting
Stress is a painful cycle.

Im hoping for the best.. But im honest enough with myself that hope is always the light through the clouds of doubt

The hardest part of being lonely is when youre surrounded by people and the dramas that play out around you…

Tonight i will go to sleep listening for the rain to start falling….my mistakes are vast.. Most lessions learned the hard way.. But the one thing i will never faulter on; is my family. 

This has never been easy…. Im exhausted… im sorry for yelling and im sorry if i made you feel like i wasnt listening .. But i hope you know i said was everything i needed to feel.. But it was everything i didnt mean.

Pain is the hardest emotion to feel.. Hardest to endour… strongest to break unbareable to think and devastating to experience

It was one of the hardest days.. And id be lying if i didnt admit part of me doesnt want to close my eyes…

That was the last 6 hrs of my day through emotional cliches.....


Between you and me im broken… or at leas barely hanging on to being able to live up to everyones standards of what i need to be for them.  I promise im trying.. I broke my promise to my kids that would not yell...they may have understood or said it was okay but it wasnt i got angry… i will forever aplogize to my kids that i make mistakes to.. I cry and their mom is not a superohero.

I love us..our crew of misfit choas… i know its hard and that doesnt even begin to explain how parenting feels but i do get it.. I have been listening.. And im trying my best… i just dont know what i can do anymore to proove it.  I can do this ive been on my own for a long time.. I pushed myself hard but it was always easier to be the one that is failed the most by my own actions. 

""Stay strong..  I have to be…. "" ringing inn my ear

I said a lot of things.. It may sound like an excuse.. But i broke today.. I couldnt stay strong … my heart broke… my fears over came me. Tonight i realized as much as this all was.. The tears.. The heart ache.. The anger.. And the disappointment in myself i will carry.. Im not sorry. Im human the pain was just to much.

It hurts to breath.. Sigh

I guess I’ll start with what this girl did to me. 

Back in October 2018 I had a decant circle of friends and my best friend was this girl (we’ll call her K). We got in an argument over something small and then she took it to Instagram by writing 7 rant posts about me and how ‘disgustingly toxic’ of a person I am. K continued to ignore me in real life and then blocked me online after she told all the people in our friend group multiple rumors about me. Because of this everyone in the group literally hates me now? They all continued to attack me and spread rumors about me until I had to go to the school to get like internet restraining orders basically. It’s stupid and ridiculous. Every day I get glared at since they can’t say anything and any chance I make a mistake one of them is there to nonchalantly comment on it. 

I struggle with depression and an eating disorder so these events had me stay in an anorexic state for months, I’m still in it like a hole that’s just getting bigger and bigger. I’ve been alone constantly since then because I have a hard time making friends (especially when half the school knows lies about you) I also had night terrors about the events for about 2 months after the whole thing happened.

I really wish I could go more in depth but I really don’t have the energy, I’m sorry. 

The only person who stayed my friend was this guy (we’ll call him kav). Kav decided to stay friends with both of K and I and I decide not to say anything about because he wasn’t picking sides by being friends with both of us. I soon forgot about it and me and Kav became best friends after all we had been close before. We even agreed to go to prom together.  I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on it just cause I can finally go out and have some genuine fun again, it’s a really big jump for me and it’s so important to me.

Tonight I found out they were dating. I remembered her password to her Instagram and I was just curious. (Curiosity killed that cat) I know this is WRONG! I shouldn’t have even done that because that’s such an invasion of privacy but I wanted to see her posts to see if she still wrote about me (I was told in December by a peer who followed her that she was still making posts about me)  and In the process I peeked at the messages and all it is is just that. They have been dating since late December I think and it breaks my heart. I don’t understand  it either because they are both hiding it from their friends. He hasn’t told anyone and she won’t talk about it online or anything either which is bewildering because from the messages I read both their parents know. 

For someone’s who’s my best friend I don’t really understand why he would do something like this. I don’t really know what to do as normally I’d come clean and be honest but I don’t think I can take another ounce of this. I feel so fucking sick. As soon as I start to pick myself up and start meeting new people I knocked down again. It’s been 5 months and I’m still antagonized daily. All I do is put up a wall and don’t let it break. All I can do is report the things they are doing to me but it never fucking ends.  I’m so tired and exhausted I can’t take this shit anymore. 

How am I gonna go to prom too? “Hey is your girlfriend okay with us going? :)” Makes me wonder. I don’t know what would be worse, K knowing that I liked him enough to go to prom only to be made fun of? Or that she doesn’t know and he’s really just that two-faced.

I'm so tired of putting myself out there for relationships and friends. I only get shit flung at me when I try really hard to be there for people. I'm so tired of it. I just can't care anymore.

I got dumped, twice, by someone who I thought cared about me enough to not treat me like garbage. I can't tell if it hurts or not anymore. I wish I never saw his face again and I wish all the good thoughts and memories I have of him would go away forever so I could only have disdain for how he treated me when he decided he was done with me after all the time and effort we both put in. I thought I had finally found a good guy after going through a lot with others, and after a bit over a year, all of a sudden, I just wasn't good enough for anyone anymore. I busted my ass helping him with whatever he needed, and making sure he was feeling okay rather than worrying about myself and my health. And of course he doesn't fucking appreciate anything I do. Didn't listen to a word I said or even cared whenever I said something exciting was happening to me. And he had the nerve to go back to me just because he was sad about it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and not even two weeks later he decided he was done with me. I was miserable when he came back, but I tried my best to rekindle what we had by just being my same self with him. If I tried to talk about what happened before, he'd laugh when I tried to talk about how I felt, and told me I was ridiculous and that he ""didn't see it that way"", despite it clearly being that way and him telling me later that it was ""that way"". If I started to cry, he ignored it and said he ""couldn't do anything for me"". I'm so upset at myself for giving him another chance.

&amp;#x200B;

And oh the nerve. Oh the nerve when I posted on my Snap story that I got accepted on a scholarship to go study abroad, and within a minute he texts me a congrats message. This was after the second time he dumped me. After he said nothing about it the whole time, and ignored me when I was really excited and going through the process of applying. After claiming he had ""nothing to say"" over anything happening in my life. I just texted thank you back but I was so angry inside. Now that I'm supposedly out of your life, now it's okay to text me and pretend to care. I hate these games, I won't play them and it hurts when people think they can play them with me.  


I hate that I'm so trusting of people. I hate that I go out of my way to help people automatically.  Why can't I just not give a shit? I only get burned and burned time again and I don't even know why I bother. I'm scared of most people now. I have a desk job at school, and that's fine, cause I'm so detached from the fact that they are people, and I just try to act like a normal person. It seems to work fine. No one suspects a thing, which is good; I don't want anyone to know how I really feel. But I don't want friends, despite the fact that I'm cripplingly lonely day by day. The only thing that fills the void is talking to people online. Not in a romantic or sexual way, just talking. It's not as scary and I feel a little better. But it doesn't last very long.

My mother beats me (not as much anymore, she just destroys my stuff instead) and screams at me and tells me I'm a horrible person, and I've believed it my whole damn life, no matter how much meds I'm on or the counselors who say it isn't true, or other people who say it isn't. It feels like all smoke and mirrors to me. Just tell me I'm horrible, just tell me I don't deserve anything. Just fucking be honest with me for once instead of building my hopes up only to have them crash to the floor again.

My dad just is so detached from family, and for some reason he's framed me as a ""golden child"" while he treats everyone else like dogshit, which makes no sense to me. He views everyone else in the family like a financial burden, and yet not me, who needs the most monetary support at the moment. Yet he can say nasty things about me like how fat I am, and he hopes I don't just ""sit around and eat everything"". Like do you know how hurtful that is to hear? I've struggled with binge-eating for a long time, and I don't blame it on anyone else, and I've honestly tried to be better, and now apparently I ""eat everything""? It's so upsetting. I feel like all my support systems are fake and full of lies when shit like that happens.

I'm sorry for going off. I am just so sick of people. I'll be surprised if I have someone living with me in my future. I'll be surprised if I have anyone in my life in my future.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so tired of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of putting myself out there for relationships and friends. I only get shit flung at me when I try really hard to be there for people. I&amp;#39;m so tired of it. I just can&amp;#39;t care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got dumped, twice, by someone who I thought cared about me enough to not treat me like garbage. I can&amp;#39;t tell if it hurts or not anymore. I wish I never saw his face again and I wish all the good thoughts and memories I have of him would go away forever so I could only have disdain for how he treated me when he decided he was done with me after all the time and effort we both put in. I thought I had finally found a good guy after going through a lot with others, and after a bit over a year, all of a sudden, I just wasn&amp;#39;t good enough for anyone anymore. I busted my ass helping him with whatever he needed, and making sure he was feeling okay rather than worrying about myself and my health.

Fed up with the amount of bloatware that Samsung pre-installs on their devices, I decided to go with a Google Pixel 3xl.  I ordered the unlocked phone from Amazon because I didn't want to get locked into a contract with my current carrier (and I didn't realize ordering directly from Google was an option at the time).

I had the phone for about a month, and it worked great... until one day I noticed that I wasn't able to get any phone calls or texts.  Signal strength was just... gone.  Nobody else I knew with my carrier had this problem, so the problem was isolated to me in some way.  So I start chatting with google support, they had me run through the usual diagnostic steps (reset network settings, re-seat SIM card, etc.), and none of that helped.  So finally they decide the device must be defective, so they ask me for some additional information for the warranty.  I didn't have it.

Lesson 1: NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER order a phone from an Amazon reseller.  Maybe you'll get lucky and never have an issue with it, or maybe you'll end up like me, trying to wring basic information out of the world's most incompetent support staff.

In order to get further support for my device, Google was demanding something called the ""Google Store Order Id"", which I of course did not have since I did not order the device through the Google Store.  So I contacted the seller I purchased the device from.  TWICE their replies went something like this: ""Try this [email address removed]"" (It literally said ""email address removed, that's not me censoring information here).  First of all, that does not in any way resemble an ""order id"", second, I have no idea who the hell this email address belongs to that they (finally) were able to send me.  Meanwhile, google support was EXTREMELY unhelpful.  I try to tell them that I'm dealing with some really clueless seller support, and could they please tell me what exactly I'm looking for, I don't know what a ""Google Store Order Id is"".  Their replies were always dismissive and repetitive:
""Oh sorry to hear that.  That's okay.  Just get us the Google Store Order Id and we'll proceed"".
""But what IS the google store order id?  Like... is it numbers?  is it an email address?  What is it!?""
""Just get us the Google Store Order-"" fuck it.

Eventually, I get something resembling an order Id, which I then give to google support, and they then ask me for the email address that ordered the product... so uh... I give them the address the seller gave me earlier when I was asking for the order Id.  Surprise surprise, it doesn't match.  This continued on for about a MONTH before I finally stopped trying to talk to the seller, and went to Amazon support directly.

Amazon, to their credit, was extremely helpful.  We tried a few more diagnostic steps, and when those failed to fix the issue, they put me in touch with _actual living breathing_ google support.  I didn't know such a thing even existed!  My previous interactions had all been through chat and email, and were extremely unhelpful.  They suggested I try swapping out the sim card for a fresh one.  I couldn't do that with them on the line (this was late at night), so it would have to wait until the next day.  They promised they would call me back the next day at a certain time, so I was overjoyed knowing that I would not have to start over from scratch with a different support person the next day.

The next day, after trying to swap out the SIM card for a new one (which didn't work), and waiting a few hours for a callback from support that never came, I called up Amazon support again.  This time, we decided that a refund would be the best way to proceed.  They told me that the return window (30 days) had closed, but since I tried for a very long time to resolve the issue before coming to them, they would make an exception.

Finally, the nightmare was at an end, right!?  Now all that I had left to do was pick out a new phone.  I didn't want to risk getting sent another lemon, so I decided to go with a different model of phone (a difficult choice... I really really liked that phone ignoring the fact that it broke after about a month).  I decided on a Samsung Galaxy Note 9.

Learning from my earlier mistake, I decided to order directly from Samsung.com, rather than risk having to deal with an incompetent middle-man later should anything go wrong.

Lesson 2: NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER order anything from Samsung.com.  Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll actually ship your shit before it's supposed to arrive... or maybe you'll end up like me, trying to explain to a support person that it is not physically possible for something to arrive before it has actually shipped.

So there I am, excitedly waiting Thursday afternoon for the phone to arrive.  Excited to have a working phone after being dragged along for about a month by a shitty reseller.  I wanted to see what time it was estimated to arrive, so I looked up the tracking number.  Hmm, that's odd... I can't find any tracking number anywhere on their website.  Finally, I decide to just open up a support chat window.

First things first, you don't get to a person right away, you have to navigate the gauntlet laid out by the world dumbest bot.
""Hello u/BeigeAlert1!  I'm Samsung's automated Virtual Agent. Here to help you.""
It presents a list of options to choose from.  I click ""Orders""
""Great! Here are your orders that are open and delivered in the last 30 days""
It presents a list of the items I've just ordered.
""Would you like more help with your Orders?""
My first thought is ""no of course not, I just wanted to look up my order in the least efficient way imaginable"", but then I remembered I was trying to get a tracking number.
So I answer ""yes""
""Sorry  please select from one of the options we could help you with.  Would you like more help with your Orders?""
.......so I answer ""yes""
""Alright here are more options to assist with your orders"" (what the fuck?)

FINALLY I get through to an actual person... (or maybe a smarter bot?).  I'm just going to paste the actual transcript here... this is the stupidest damn thing I've seen in a long time.
&gt; Support: I have checked the order status,your order has been confirmed and ready to ship. Once your order is shipped,you will get the tracking id through the mail

&gt; Me: ...ready to ship???  It's supposed to be here today.  Why hasn't it shipped yet?  I'm seeing ""Expected delivery Mar 14, 2019"" I ordered it 4 days ago, why hasn't it shipped yet? Furthermore, why haven't I been charged for it yet?

&gt; Support: Yes, the expected date of delivery is 14 maerch.

&gt; Me: that's today, and you're telling me it hasn't even shipped yet

&gt; Support: I understand your situation.I will forward the issue to the appropriate team.

&gt; Me: thank you

&gt; Support: They will get back to you in 4 business days.

&gt; Me: ... I revoke my ""thank you""

They never offered an explanation for the delay.  They never apologized for the delay.  They just ducked every question I asked, and acted like nothing was wrong.  When I asked them to cancel the order, they said it couldn't be done (bullshit... nothing has shipped yet, of course it can be cancelled, they just don't want to).

So after speaking to my credit card company, they will happily dispute the charge for me if the item does not arrive by the day it was supposed to (It just shipped today, 2 days after it was set to arrive).

At this point, I'm getting dangerously close to losing my refund from Amazon (item needs to be returned within 30 days), and I need a working phone... so I just sucked it up and went to a retailer nearby.  Turns out, they had the exact same item I had just ordered online, and I walked out of the store with a working phone less than an hour later.

So here I am now... just wondering what the next thing to go wrong will be.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time had come to finally replace my faithful Galaxy Note 3 of the past 5 years, and I was looking for a new phone.

I am on medication and in treatment, which isn't enough to prevent this. This is something I have to deal with. Obviously, I still have a lot to learn.

My mom thoroughly enjoys posting ""need prayers for unexplained situation"", but it's only to garner attention. If her friends knew about the reasons she is requesting prayer, she'd lose a lot of her attention. Today, she made a prayer request post that was hinting at me ruining her day.

What happened was, she decided it'd be a great idea to start something by inviting my ex, who used to live with her strangely enough, to stay the night. I had no clue they were planning to go to an amusement park the next day, including my brother and his friend. My CPS (Child Protective Services) worker had officially kicked my ex out at the beginning of this case due to him, well, being my ex and causing an unneeded altercation against my fiancé. My CPS worker is trying to look out for me by making sure I feel comfortable while taking care of my daughter.

Well, they return. My grandmother and aunt come over shortly after with my daughter. I had no clue until I thought I heard her crying upstairs. Keep in my mind, I'm technically not allowed to live there, but my mom offered while we were in a vulnerable situation. I'm not going to be there for much longer at all. I hate it there and would rather be homeless, but there is a better plan in mind now.

Anyways, I started panicking. ""She better not have my daughter around that fucker."" I rush outside to check the deiveway, and sure enough he is still there. I call my CPS worker before anything, first off. I can't be screaming. No response, she's already asleep. I call my fiancé and explain. He's pissed too, but warns me against screaming and acting out. As soon as the call ends, I'm full of so much rage because this is so wrong. I don't care if he's in physical contact of her or minding his business, the CPS worker said absolutely not from the start. I don't want him here, and this is EXACTLY why. Shit will go down. Something my CPS worker wants to avoid.

I run up the stairs. After the second sentence, I'm already screaming at the top of my lungs. My mom is clutching my daughter in her arms, like I'd ever hurt my beautiful daughter. I raged hard and let it all go. I told them how I felt. ""Fuck off! Fuck you! FUCK ALL OF YOU!! He doesn't need to be around MY daughter! He needs to LEAVE. NOW!"" I'm trembling and on the verge of tears as I retreat back downstairs. I pace furiously and punch the wall.

The next thing I had to do was call my dad so I can vent the rest of my frustrations away. I can't stand silence when I'm pissed. I need someone who cares, to let me know that I need to keep fighting, but at least be smarter about it. I know I can be overreactive, and that will one day be the downfall of me.

My dad is one of the only people of my family who will tell me how it is, knows that mom is manipulative and narcissistic, and he gives me words of wisdom that help me keep on track. ""Let her mess up. Don't let her get to you, she can use that against you. Her life is already falling apart. I may not get to see it, but you will. It's already happening."" It's true, she knows what she's doing. She's only making it worse on herself.

Once I get my daughter back, I will refuse to let my mom, and perhaps my grandmother, around her. In fear that they will manipulate her later in life, just as they tried with me so many years. They ruined my life and I felt crazy for thinking it was a normal family situation. I was terribly wrong. My dad always told me my mom wasn't treating us right anymore aftrr their divorce. My fiancé helped me realize the abuse they brought upon me, and a lot more of my life made sense. I believe that is the reason my mom and grandmother insist I leave my fiancé, is because he sees through the lies and deception. There's no reason to leave someone who has done nothing but sacrifice so much to keep me happy and help me through my toughest struggles. And, he absolutely loves and adores our daughter.

They want to see me fail. My mom wants my daughter to be adopted so that I will never have her. She treats my daughter as if she belongs to her, even though I'm the one with the fresh cesarean scar across my abdomen. She loves the attention of people who think my daughter is hers. My mom never tags me in the posts, nor does she explain who my daughter is or what her name is. Her friends sympathize her for ""going through rough times"". What rough times? You mean the situation she put herself through? Being a 12-hour shift nurse who insist she get custody instead of the other family members more able than her? I wanted her to be with my aunt, her sister who she has a kindled grudge against, but somehow that got flipped. I wonder how and by who.

So, that's my life thus far. I have confidence I'll get my daughter back and the judge will realize what's going on. I'm doing everything I need to, besides the screaming part. Within the next day, I will be away from this drama.

TL;DR I feel bad because I don't have much of a justification to complain about our new roommate(s), but it sucks and I need to vent.

I live with my long-term boyfriend. He owns the property we live in from an inheritance, and we have 2 wonderful roommates. They each pay rent, but I don't. I do pay an equal share of utilities. Recently, my boyfriend surprised me by mentioning that one of his best friends from high school would be staying with us. This was right before Christmas, and this friend's wife lives in our city, so I assumed it was a short stay (he had stayed with us before, as his wife had recently been forced to find a new home after a fire and was staying on a friend's couch while the insurance claim went through.)

The day before my boyfriend's HS buddy was coming in, my BF mentioned he had to get our spare room ready for ""Dan"" to move in. I said ""move in? I thought this was just for the holidays so Dan could spend time with his wife?"" 

Turns out, Dan's wife was applying for new jobs across the country, and didn't want to buy new property only to move away in a few months. So Dan is moving in to our spare room (which is our den, it gets pretty frequent use from us when there are no guests.) Our den also does not have a bathroom, so Dan uses one of our roommate's bathrooms.

All this is fine. I can handle a few months. But then Dan's wife moves in with him. Obviously my BF, being a good friend, doesn't charge them rent. He also doesn't charge utilities (he split the utilities to account for the extra people but he is covering it). While my BF and I have separate bank accounts, we don't track our individual expenses and often give money to each other and alternate joint purchases, so this extra expense has a small effect on our lives (we often need to help each other out as one of our accounts may go low and the other covers. Now my BF has his account go lower more often and I need to cover for him).

Recently, I asked my BF how long the two of them would be staying, as it had reached the 3 month mark. He said ""probably a year. Dan's wife needs to get things together here before she moves, and even if she gets a job offer she may delay it for a full year and do some non-profit work here while she settles her affairs."" 

LIKE, WHAT? I'm sorry, but seriously??? I know everyone involved is nice and trying to get their lives together. I also know I have no right to confront my boyfriend, as I also don't pay rent and he's known Dan for longer than I have known my BF, but I need to vent. My BF sprung this on me and I have to live with two people who have loud sex and smoke weed in our backyard (no issue with their choice, but we live in a family neighborhood and I don't want that iconic smell to spread to our neighbors and have problems with them. No one else in the house smokes). And this may go on for another year! 

I'm tired of our over-crowded household. I'm tired of hearing them. It's small, but I miss using that room. I'm frustrated because there is no timetable. I'm frustrated because I'm an asshole for resenting the presence of these two people that need a place to stay, and I can't bring it up with my BF, especially because I also don't pay rent. I just want to confront them, ask them what their plans are. Ask why they can't rent an apartment for the next year. Or live with Dan's parents (who ALSO live in the city, but an hour drive from downtown where as we live 5 minutes from the train and a 20 minute drive). 

I'm just sick of this situation, and how it was presented to me, and I need to complain about it. I'll probably bring it up with my BF once my job calms down.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I feel bad because I don&amp;#39;t have much of a justification to complain about our new roommate(s), but it sucks and I need to vent.&lt;/p&gt;

Life as a very young child was easy. Around that time I wasn't even properly aware. My parents mistreat me but I was too dumb to truly understand it. They used to call me a bad child and constantly try to make me feel bad. At one point when I was very young I remember they tried taking me to nursery but I just wouldn't settle when the other kids sat down to listen to a story. This was because I wanted to spend this time playing and running around (something I couldn't do in my own home.) I admit, I probably wasn't an easy child to cope with. I was wild and wanted to play and run all the time. This put a lot of stress on my father at the time. He was depressed and most likely didn't want me. His way of dealing with me and my brother when we were too loud or if we ever became stir crazy and argued was to beat us. Sure, beating your children may be necessary in some situations. But it wasn't necessary in most of the situations he did it. He beat us for simply playing too loud when my mother was asleep (she worked at night) or simply because me and him argued over a toy. My father was not a reasonable man. He also did not hold back when he hit us. He was a cold, cruel unsympathetic man. Both my parents were very controlling and didn't let us out much during our early days. They did take us out somewhere nice like once a week but it was never enough for us. We were incredibly bored which made our behaviour frustrating for my parents whenever they took us to the store or to somewhere boring. Despite this kind of existence I was still a happy child. At the time I wasn't really aware of the way my parents were treating me. Some time when I was probably around 7 I realised I didn't love my father. He was a monster and I could see it as clear as day. It sounds very stupid but I wanted to be bigger and badder than him. I wanted to eventually beat the living shit out of him and I made it a life time goal (it's stupid I know but I guess all dreams are stupid).

&amp;#x200B;

As high school started I was forced to change. This was mainly due to bullying. It was a public school and was quite toxic and ruled by idiotic bullies. At first I was still quite wild even at that age and didn't think twice about beating somebody who wronged me but this was not enough. I needed to play it smarter as I didn't have the popularity others had. I needed self control and to plan every possible move. So I forced myself to change. And through this change I worked to build up my popularity. Throughout my school life I was involved in violence towards other kids who I deemed wronged me in some way. The way I saw it was if anyone challenged me or tried to make me look bad, I'd fight them and humiliate them in front of an audience. This neanderthal logic was stupid and I knew it, but it worked. That's because the sheep ruled over that place. Despite this, I still held onto a decent social status (which at the time meant everything to me). Eventually people stopped lining up to fight me and learned to leave me alone. I also had to protect my brother through school though from similar kinds of people so I never really got much peace. I often fought his battles for him but it wasn't enough to protect him. I did this because I cared about him, but part of me also just wanted a justifiable reason to hurt others. As you can tell, I have an affinity towards violence and being in that environment desensitised me quite a lot. I don't even know if I like violence or just the power you feel when you hurt someone else. I assume it's the power because throughout my early life I have felt powerless. I was very specific about how I would humiliate others and dethrone them. It was usually planned and I would hurt the person on the 3rd time they say something abusive to me. I always made sure there was an audience when it happened to justify it and for them to witness the person getting humiliated so they would spread the word about their weakness and my strength. Then it would look like I was just getting mad and retaliating from their harassment and the guy I beat up will get bullied by the dumb sheep. People always ate up the excuse ""He said \_\_\_\_\_ so I got angry and hit him"". Haha yeah, people expect that kind of thing from a teen. Despite all this I seemed very approachable and laid back to most people as they always saw me retaliating and never starting conflict. This meant people either really liked me or hated me. Overall High school was very stressful for me despite most stuff going to plan and I used video games and social media to escape the hell I created for myself while I was at home. Another thing to mention is once I began getting violent my father stopped beating me. I think he realised eventually what he's done. What he made. And I know for sure he knew I would turn on him eventually. I am a retaliator though, and since he never lay a finger on me again, I never got my revenge. Instead me and my brother would only psychologically mess with him which is fine I guess. It's not the same but it will do.

&amp;#x200B;

When high school ended I was finally free. I no longer needed to act the way I did like the past 5 years. Towards the end I became very tired of having to be constantly looking over my shoulder. I could finally switch off and relax. What I was doing never felt right but I kept doing it. I saw it as self preservation but it didn't really help with the guilt. I used to purposely forced myself to do terrible things to people just to ensure I didn't look weak. I was constantly struggling with my own morality throughout high school. I understand I brought unhappiness to some peoples lives, but I still saw myself as worse off. I was living with constant guilt every time I did something bad. Hurting others would feel nice in the moment but I'd lie in bed for hours at night and think about what I've done and it would keep me awake. I was such a bastard and I played myself off as a nice person when I really wasn't. But times have changed. I no longer needed to act. I could finally be myself. Only, I didn't know how to act ""myself"" anymore. After 5 years of what felt like acting I was left feeling hollow. I had no real interests or goals, no hopes for the future, nothing. My entire life was consumed by focusing on the petty high school social game. I was a fool. Now I needed to build myself up anew while at college and that's exactly what I tried to do. When I started college everyone acted like normal human beings. It shocked me. I recall feeling safe. That is when I realised that my school (that was once my whole world) was incredibly bad. I also realised I was one of the worse human beings in my classes. I did meet a couple people worse than me, but other than those I knew everyone else were better people. I made friends but when I finished college I became very depressed and just let them all go. I couldn't be bothered to maintain my friends once the one thing forcing me to see them was gone. Some still try to bother with me every so often weirdly, maybe due to the fact they think I'm worth their time despite my elusiveness but I struggle to even keep in touch with them nowadays.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I got a job but it wasn't at all ideal. This work was heavy physical labour and very demanding. They often made me do things I wasn't comfortable doing like driving a vehicle when I didn't have a license. I also had to carry very heavy things around instead of using vehicles/machines to do the job. It was brutal. On my first day I felt like shit but I stuck to it. The people there were unpleasant but bearable despite their blatant disrespect for others and their lack of personal hygiene. The manager was also a scumbag and was constantly testing me. But due to me being in the real world now I restrained my nature from trying to assault this man and just laughed it off instead. Eventually the manager went on holiday for 3 weeks. Work during that time was not good but it was better. When he was around he was a slave driver. When he returned stuff went back to normal and I just snapped. I said a lot of things which a cool and calculated person shouldn't have said and then quit my job. I have not worked since.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I had nothing in my life, no hobbies, friends or job I descended into a deep incurable sadness. No matter what happens I cannot get out. I see no reason to get up in the morning. I eat and drink once a day just due to necessity. I rarely go out anymore and spend most of my time in a house when I don't even enjoy being here. I am miserable and so is my brother. The only difference is my brother talks to others about his own unhappiness. I can't do that. I'm too stubborn. Besides, nobody else really cares how others feel anyway. My parents never cared, friends never cared, nobody ever cared. Even if my brother cared I cannot burden him with my own issues. I am a wreck. A sad, tired freak with nothing going for them. I often find myself thinking ""I wish I was dead"". I often wonder if I truly mean that though or if I just wish I had a life instead. I just do not feel alive anymore. I am living like a dog and not even my parents want to help me. I guess this is what happens when your mental health slips too far and nobody is there to help you get back up.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more I could go into. I could go into the details of every major part of my short life. But I feel like that would be too long winded (it's already bad as it is). There is also other awful things which have happened to me which I do not want to relive by writing about them. I have whined enough about my life as it is. Please excuse my negativity and ""edginess"" as I grew up without much positive things happening to me. I'm just so tired of bottling it all to myself. I am beyond tired. I feel pure emotional fatigue. I just need a release, and writing this might be it. I'm sorry.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life as a very young child was easy.

Story:
In January, I was put in charge of a project that was under her belt last year. Boss put me in charge of it as it’s been a concern for some of our clients. I tried touching base with B TWICE on what I needed to know, to which she said “there is nothing I need to really share with you, go talk to (guy who works under her)”. So I did this yada yada.

Fast forward to now, there was a recent challenge regarding the project, I had a meeting with clients and staff involved and made a plan moving forward. That same day, B tells me in person and via email that her staff (who facilitates part of the project) is confused about expectations on it and would like to meet on Friday. I agree and think it’s a clarification or possible staff concern. 

Boy was I wrong, I recently checked the calendar invite and B actually invited all ppl involved in the project and my boss (who declined cuz she know’s B’s MO). So I’m thinking WTH, email B saying along the lines of “Please clarify the purpose of this meeting, I was under the impression that I was clarifying expectations with your staff. I am open to hearing any feedback you or staff may have but moving forward please touch base with me in person if you have an specific concerns I can address before we schedule a larger meeting”. 

B responds with “I told you that we are meeting with all staff and supervisors involved in person, do you need me to schedule a meeting with only us before another meeting”. B NEVER mentioned inviting everyone, I have this evidence via email too. I don’t mind talking to everyone because I have nothing to hide but, just...wth? Does this sound a little manipulative? BTW forgot to mention that she sits right next to me in our shared office.

I’m just very frustrated at this point. 😤 

Edit: grammar","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m (26f) just over this girl (B) at work who I can tell doesn’t think I’m doing my job the way she would want it done. Tbh, i don’t really care what she thinks because (1) she isn’t my boss, (2) she hasn’t proven to me that she can do better than I, and (3) she hasn’t brought her concerns in an assertive way to my face in person for any changes to be made. If you want to support a change, communicate about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story:
In January, I was put in charge of a project that was under her belt last year. Boss put me in charge of it as it’s been a concern for some of our clients. I tried touching base with B TWICE on what I needed to know, to which she said “there is nothing I need to really share with you, go talk to (guy who works under her)”. So I did this yada yada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, there was a recent challenge regarding the project, I had a meeting with clients and staff involved and made a plan moving forward. That same day, B tells me in person and via email that her staff (who facilitates part of the project) is confused about expectations on it and would like to meet on Friday. I agree and think it’s a clarification or possible staff concern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong, I recently checked the calendar invite and B actually invited all ppl involved in the project and my boss (who declined cuz she know’s B’s MO). So I’m thinking WTH, email B saying along the lines of “Please clarify the purpose of this meeting, I was under the impression that I was clarifying expectations with your staff. I am open to hearing any feedback you or staff may have but moving forward please touch base with me in person if you have an specific concerns I can address before we schedule a larger meeting”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B responds with “I told you that we are meeting with all staff and supervisors involved in person, do you need me to schedule a meeting with only us before another meeting”. B NEVER mentioned inviting everyone, I have this evidence via email too. I don’t mind talking to everyone because I have nothing to hide but, just...wth? Does this sound a little manipulative?

We're still on good terms, so he came over for the weekend. I still live with my parents, so almost everything we did was confined to my room. As I have a bit of a problem keeping it tidy and due to the layout and furniture there's only a relatively small area you can properly walk (not full on messy, you'd just run into a table or shelf if you strayed too far) I like to keep this walkway clear of stuff. I also am a bit of a clutz, so I'm always a bit worried about stepping on or tripping over things in the way.

For the 2.5 years we were together pretty much each time he was over I would have to remind him to please not put stuff on that small path, which he constantly would forget to do. What always made me most nervous was, that he would also put headphones on the ground.

This time he brought the new headphones he recently got as a gift. For whatever reason he still used my headphones at my PC for some reason. Instead of putting them back on the table where he must have retrieved them from he put them on the ground.

Again, my room doesn't offer much space for movement, so when we were sitting at the PC together there wasn't much space to my right. I wanted to get up turn on the light, didn't bother pushing my chair behind his to have more space. I then stumbled and stepped on my headphones. Now the left right cup is broken, only held by the cable. I don't know if they still work, but even if they do I'll have to glue it on in a way, that it won't be able to turn.

Yes, *I* stepped on them. Yes, I downplayed it, because I'm genuinely glad that I didn't step on his damn awesome new headphones.

But it still wouldn't have happened, if he just for one goddamned time would have actually done what I've been asking him to do almost every time he was at my place for the entirety of our relationship.

If he wasn't broke af, about to become homeless and already owed me a lot of money I would want him to pay me back in some way. But I feel it's to late to ask for that, because as said I downplayed it yesterday (though I'll admit, that my ""at least it weren't yours"" (because they were laying right besides each other) and ""and that's why I tell you to not put headphones on the ground"" were a bit unnecessarily passive-aggressive...) and just deciding the next day that I want compensation would feel very out of the blue for him, especially seeing his current situation. I could add it to his standing debt, but that wouldn't really help me with anything and doing that behind his back would feel very dishonest. But he can't just keep on disregarding the rules for my personal space if he wants to be in this space.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Ex, with whom I'm on good terms, came over to visit, disregards the request that he not put stuff on the floor for 3 years, uses my headphones despite having his own, puts them on the floor instead of back on the table and I step on them breaking one of the cups.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (21f) broke up with my ex (24m) around 4 months ago.

I haven't had a strong dream or goal as to what I want to be or do with myself. I try to give myself a sense of progression by making smaller or short term goals. My most recent goal is my motorcycle license. Respectfully, please don't try to convince me not to ride. I'm sure you're a good person but it's irrelevant to my actual worry. Besides I dont have the money for one anyway. I saved most of my money for the classes to get the license so I won't actually be on two wheels for a while anyway.

I don't really have a smooth segue for this. I do my best to be a good person but I'm afraid that it won't be good enough.

In turn I get removed from the entire field of work I've spent my prime working to get into, and the reason for it never being actually told to me. This is probably a worst case scenario and I'm probably exaggerating a bit myself, but I never said my fear was rational. 

Motorcycles and the community surrounding them helps me take my mind off of all those worries as of late.

Sorry but I just have to vent

This post was brought on by the annoying audience of Captain Marvel. I saw it last night and for the most part, enjoyed it. The thing that ruined my whole experience was some jackass behind me cheering when Nick Fury was introduced, when Agent Coulson was introduced, when Ronan the Accuser was introduced, when Goose destroyed an army. It got tiring hearing someone cheer, causing the whole theater to cheer. I am really annoyed by it. I understand at test screenings to show that they really enjoy one scene, but when watching a movie, it gets tedious. People should just laugh and gasp during movies and for the most part, just shut up.

The same thing happened during Creed 2 when I saw it at my college movie theater. Whenever Creed knocked down Drago, every fucking person cheered. Everyone. And if you watched the film, the ending has Drago in a more sympathetic light. Drago gets knocked down three times and the whole audience cheered... three times.

The sad thing is that I really want to see Avengers Endgame, Shazam, Godzilla, Hellboy, Spiderman, etc. but the audience mentality for cheering over every little thing is starting to get to me. I was close to yelling at the guy to just shut up. I noticed it doesn't happen for small indie films and I think that's because the audience is more respectful and they're there to enjoy a movie like everyone else, not because they just want to be in-the-know with their friends.

Especially at this point in my life. I'm 30 years old, a male with a technical career and a well paying job. I have a girlfriend of 10 years and a five month old baby. I've always had a bit of depression but I've managed it my whole life. But my management is failing. My mom passed away in 2012, every day it feels like it was yesterday. Since my mom passed away my dad threw away my childhood home, his business that he worked my whole life to build, all his money and started sending large sums of money to a female in Ghana. In September my dad had a stroke, one week before my daughter was born, then another in november. I have been left to pick up the pieces. I had to clean his whole apartment, pay his bills and manage his accounts. I regularly meet with doctors, care managers and nurses. I had to tour facilities and budget his money and pensions to get him the best care affordable. I have three siblings who haven't done a single thing to help me. It has all fallen on my shoulders. I get the calls at work or in the middle of the night if he falls, I'm the one who makes all the decisions in his life now, alone. I hate it. I don't hate being there for my dad I hate that no one else has helped me. My job is a true dead end. I'm a heavy equipment technician, it is a very strenuous and thankless job. The company I work for says they don't give raises because they don't want to create inequality amongst employees. No, they're cheap. The same reason we don't have an incentives, and tool or boot allowance, bonuses or even a Christmas party. I know this may sound silly but when you've put years of you life into training and tool purchases it's not very nice going to work every day knowing you will never ever advance from that position or even be rewarded for your hard work. My girlfriend doesn't really appreciate me, she also regularly tells me it's not her job to help me with my depression and to go get help, which is obviously much easier said than done. When we had our daughter I decided I would do all housework so all her energy could go into our daughter. I cook, I clean, I shop, I take care of the cats, the laundry, I just try my best to make sure she's comfortable so she can put maximum energy into our daughter. But that isn't really how it's played out. I've created this extremely unappreciative person who just expects meals cooked and things to be done. I'm happy to do things, but I want that loving appreciated feeling, I feel like some women out there would give anything for a guy that does all the housework without being asked. Any tevi bring it up or say I don't feel appreciated or ask her to do more around the house because I feel weighed down she just gets angry, tells me I don't have to get up at night for feedings or sit at home all day with a baby. So my feelings are irrelevant. Or she'll get really mad and leave the house and take our baby over to her families. Another thing I'm struggling with is I don't use social media, I don't have Facebook, twitter, snap, insta, I live my life outside of that bubble. But I'm starting to feel so alone, everyone is always on Facebook rubbing their opiions in each other's faces and arguing about vaccines or abortion and I just don't fit into that world. My girlfriend spends more time on Facebook socializing and arguing topics than she does socializing with me. Sometimes when we're talking she'll just pick up her phone and start scrolling. It's heartbreaking. It's like everyone forgot how we were before smart phones and social media, I feel like I'm the only normal person left. I just can't cope any more, being a parent without parents is devastating. The only thing in this world I want to do is share my daughter with my mom and dad and I can't. I'm so jealous all the time of my girlfriend, she has a big family that wants to be really involved, I have a very small spread out family. I just want my parents, I'm new to this, I'm scared, I have SO many questions I'd love to ask my mom about as a baby or things she did to sooth me. I think terrible thoughts all the time. I try to push them out but they find their way back in. I wonder if anyone would notice if I was gone. I feel like my stupid family deserves the pain for all that they have put me through by not helping me with dad. I wonder if my daughter would just be better off without me, I love her so much and she's the light of my life. But how much darker is my life going to get. My dad will die soon. I'll be left alome to handle all of that. My girlfriend will just get less and less appreciative and expect more and more. What next, alone in a house with two girls who are glued to there phones? I just don't fit in. I feel it more and more every day, my life is work, cook, clean, sleep repeat. I'm a zombie. I've lost all enthusiasm, all positivity.[u](https://www.reddit.com/user/MentallyConcluded)[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/az4zan/losing_my_ability_to_cope_rapidly/)

## 

I never really thought I'd be here. Especially at this point in my life. I'm 30 years old, a male with a technical career and a well paying job. I have a girlfriend of 10 years and a five month old baby. I've always had a bit of depression but I've managed it my whole life. But my management is failing. My mom passed away in 2012, every day it feels like it was yesterday. Since my mom passed away my dad threw away my childhood home, his business that he worked my whole life to build, all his money and started sending large sums of money to a female in Ghana. In September my dad had a stroke, one week before my daughter was born, then another in november. I have been left to pick up the pieces. I had to clean his whole apartment, pay his bills and manage his accounts. I regularly meet with doctors, care managers and nurses. I had to tour facilities and budget his money and pensions to get him the best care affordable. I have three siblings who haven't done a single thing to help me. It has all fallen on my shoulders. I get the calls at work or in the middle of the night if he falls, I'm the one who makes all the decisions in his life now, alone. I hate it. I don't hate being there for my dad I hate that no one else has helped me. My job is a true dead end. I'm a heavy equipment technician, it is a very strenuous and thankless job. The company I work for says they don't give raises because they don't want to create inequality amongst employees. No, they're cheap. The same reason we don't have an incentives, and tool or boot allowance, bonuses or even a Christmas party. I know this may sound silly but when you've put years of you life into training and tool purchases it's not very nice going to work every day knowing you will never ever advance from that position or even be rewarded for your hard work. My girlfriend doesn't really appreciate me, she also regularly tells me it's not her job to help me with my depression and to go get help, which is obviously much easier said than done. When we had our daughter I decided I would do all housework so all her energy could go into our daughter. I cook, I clean, I shop, I take care of the cats, the laundry, I just try my best to make sure she's comfortable so she can put maximum energy into our daughter. But that isn't really how it's played out. I've created this extremely unappreciative person who just expects meals cooked and things to be done. I'm happy to do things, but I want that loving appreciated feeling, I feel like some women out there would give anything for a guy that does all the housework without being asked. Any tevi bring it up or say I don't feel appreciated or ask her to do more around the house because I feel weighed down she just gets angry, tells me I don't have to get up at night for feedings or sit at home all day with a baby. So my feelings are irrelevant. Or she'll get really mad and leave the house and take our baby over to her families. Another thing I'm struggling with is I don't use social media, I don't have Facebook, twitter, snap, insta, I live my life outside of that bubble. But I'm starting to feel so alone, everyone is always on Facebook rubbing their opiions in each other's faces and arguing about vaccines or abortion and I just don't fit into that world.

I just can&amp;#39;t cope any more, being a parent without parents is devastating. The only thing in this world I want to do is share my daughter with my mom and dad and I can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m so jealous all the time of my girlfriend, she has a big family that wants to be really involved, I have a very small spread out family. I just want my parents, I&amp;#39;m new to this, I&amp;#39;m scared, I have SO many questions I&amp;#39;d love to ask my mom about as a baby or things she did to sooth me. I think terrible thoughts all the time. I try to push them out but they find their way back in. I wonder if anyone would notice if I was gone. I feel like my stupid family deserves the pain for all that they have put me through by not helping me with dad. I wonder if my daughter would just be better off without me, I love her so much and she&amp;#39;s the light of my life. But how much darker is my life going to get. My dad will die soon. I&amp;#39;ll be left alome to handle all of that. My girlfriend will just get less and less appreciative and expect more and more. What next, alone in a house with two girls who are glued to there phones? I just don&amp;#39;t fit in. I feel it more and more every day, my life is work, cook, clean, sleep repeat. I&amp;#39;m a zombie. I&amp;#39;ve lost all enthusiasm, all positivity.I never really thought I&amp;#39;d be here. Especially at this point in my life. I&amp;#39;m 30 years old, a male with a technical career and a well paying job. I have a girlfriend of 10 years and a five month old baby. I&amp;#39;ve always had a bit of depression but I&amp;#39;ve managed it my whole life. But my management is failing. My mom passed away in 2012, every day it feels like it was yesterday. Since my mom passed away my dad threw away my childhood home, his business that he worked my whole life to build, all his money and started sending large sums of money to a female in Ghana. In September my dad had a stroke, one week before my daughter was born, then another in november. I have been left to pick up the pieces. I had to clean his whole apartment, pay his bills and manage his accounts. I regularly meet with doctors, care managers and nurses. I had to tour facilities and budget his money and pensions to get him the best care affordable. I have three siblings who haven&amp;#39;t done a single thing to help me. It has all fallen on my shoulders. I get the calls at work or in the middle of the night if he falls, I&amp;#39;m the one who makes all the decisions in his life now, alone. I hate it. I don&amp;#39;t hate being there for my dad I hate that no one else has helped me. My job is a true dead end. I&amp;#39;m a heavy equipment technician, it is a very strenuous and thankless job. The company I work for says they don&amp;#39;t give raises because they don&amp;#39;t want to create inequality amongst employees. No, they&amp;#39;re cheap. The same reason we don&amp;#39;t have an incentives, and tool or boot allowance, bonuses or even a Christmas party. I know this may sound silly but when you&amp;#39;ve put years of you life into training and tool purchases it&amp;#39;s not very nice going to work every day knowing you will never ever advance from that position or even be rewarded for your hard work. My girlfriend doesn&amp;#39;t really appreciate me, she also regularly tells me it&amp;#39;s not her job to help me with my depression and to go get help, which is obviously much easier said than done. When we had our daughter I decided I would do all housework so all her energy could go into our daughter. I cook, I clean, I shop, I take care of the cats, the laundry, I just try my best to make sure she&amp;#39;s comfortable so she can put maximum energy into our daughter. But that isn&amp;#39;t really how it&amp;#39;s played out. I&amp;#39;ve created this extremely unappreciative person who just expects meals cooked and things to be done. I&amp;#39;m happy to do things, but I want that loving appreciated feeling, I feel like some women out there would give anything for a guy that does all the housework without being asked. Any tevi bring it up or say I don&amp;#39;t feel appreciated or ask her to do more around the house because I feel weighed down she just gets angry, tells me I don&amp;#39;t have to get up at night for feedings or sit at home all day with a baby. So my feelings are irrelevant. Or she&amp;#39;ll get really mad and leave the house and take our baby over to her families. Another thing I&amp;#39;m struggling with is I don&amp;#39;t use social media, I don&amp;#39;t have Facebook, twitter, snap, insta, I live my life outside of that bubble. But I&amp;#39;m starting to feel so alone, everyone is always on Facebook rubbing their opiions in each other&amp;#39;s faces and arguing about vaccines or abortion and I just don&amp;#39;t fit into that world. My girlfriend spends more time on Facebook socializing and arguing topics than she does socializing with me. Sometimes when we&amp;#39;re talking she&amp;#39;ll just pick up her phone and start scrolling. It&amp;#39;s heartbreaking. It&amp;#39;s like everyone forgot how we were before smart phones and social media, I feel like I&amp;#39;m the only normal person left.

I have been working at this child are center as a cook for about 6 months now, and it just seems to be getting worse each day.

The first thing that went wrong was the lack of other teachers. I was working 10 hour days almost everyday. It was fine since I got overtime but was bad on my body and mind.

The second was when we finally got enough teachers the cool decided she wanted to be a teacher. I thought I would do great in there since I love to cook. They never gave me the required training so I have been driving blind since day one in the kitchen. 

The third thing was cutting my hours. I was working 13/he for 8 hours which then changed to 6 hours. Not only am I not able to get work done, I'm not getting paid what I agreed to when I got hired.

The fourth thing is that health insurance is talking 300 dollars a paycheck out for coverage. I'm combating this by reducing the insurance to only hospital liability and coverage, but after I get the things I need to survive.

Because of the hours and insurance payments, I got 316 dollars last paycheck; I can't survive on that so I've been using my student credit card which is not at 300 I need to pay on.

I know that alot of people might ask why I don't quit and that's because they are paying for me to go to school for my Child Development Associate degree. The classes cost 1,500 dollars and if I quit or get fired I have to pay it back myself.

But I might get fired anyways cause ever since they cut my hours I've been getting write up for not cleaning every little corner. 

The second write up was about mold on food which I found out was from that Wednesday and it only got mold because someone turned down the fridges without me knowing, they didn't get rid of the write up even though it wasn't my fault.

Now if I get written up again I will be fired and will have to get a new job and pay the school fees myself. I'm incredibly stressed and I just got off work and have to go to an empty home since  my husband still works until 6.

I just, need help. I'm 21 with so many problems and I don't know what to do. My coworker says quit and get a job that pays more since minimum wage higher up into Seattle is 15/hr but idk.

So yeah, if you read this whole thing then thank you.

Edit: as of March 15th I was fired. Apparently the tun melt sandwiches I made caused half the school to have diarrhea. Idk what they expect with they only get tune once a month so there body isn't used to it. So of course it will cause issues for the younger kids.

I now have to pay my work 1,500 dollars for the schooling they said they were going to pay and get a new job.

Some part of me wishes I could just succumb to hard drugs, too force myself down a dark path to mirror the self loathing I feel on the inside.

 Perhaps these thoughts are just the borderline pathology talking. 

One of the things about me is that even though I deal with mental health issues I still feel this need to control certain things about myself,  like self regulation, I can never fully ""be me"" or let down my guard. 
The times I have let go I feel it is a flood of emotion that makes me feel ""unhinged"" or I guess at times  it is over excitement. 
Whatever it is I know it has been with me since my earliest memories, probably since forming an anxious attachment style in my early development. 

Basically when I do feel emotion it tends to be either numbness or avoidance (so really a lack of feeling) or the other extreme and I feel it all so greatly. 

Gotta think rationally. These traits I don't think are inherently bad, they developed for a reason. To protect my fragile psyche lol.

Just need to find balance within myself.

She attempts to run, but quickly fails, the Deputy put his arm in front of her, so she can't.

I had to file an incident report, hoping now that she'll get suspended, for the 3rd time. So expelled. I'm not pissed at her for JUST stealing the phone, I'm doing a parkour trial for lessons that I could possibly be taking.

I'm lost. My entire life is being torn down in front of me. One child psychopath and her lies have thrown my life into an absolute tailspin. And no, I'm not being mellowdramatic, the child has severe mental health issues. 

From the beginning.
My husband has a girl child from a previous relationship.  After suffering neglect at her biological mother's home the child came to reside with us at age 11. I am a mental medical health professional,  and devoted myself to assisting the child through therapy to help her through her issues from the neglect. During therapy she claimed she was sexually assaulted by a friend of her mother's during a sleepover with the friends child. Her story was weak and very difficult to obtain a timeline so police dropped the investigation.  Her father was vehemently angry that the mother put the child in such a position so that she could go out and party. He fought visciously for justice, which only resulted in court orders for the mother to be fully present during their weekend visitation.  About a year later, after the child was caught by her school skipping and stealing a phone from a teacher the child accused the mother's then boyfriend of molesting her. The school, with her father's insistence moved forward to press charges against the man. Again there were consistency issues with her story, but we backed her and obtained a private lawyer. Approximately 1.5 years after this she was again caught skipping class, and was found with a mentally challenged boy in a school bathroom. Both were nude and the boy declined to speak about what the situation.  Both were suspended as a result.  During the suspension the girl child stated the boy had forcibly assaulted her in the bathroom.  The boy denied and stated the entire situation had been her idea. As the boy is mentally challenged police informed the girl child that they would be investigating her for sexual assault.  The girl continued to state that the boy forced her into the boys bathroom and forced her clothing off. We were essentially removed from the investigation and all charges were dropped after mediation.  Then she ran away. Was located at her mother's home where she was found to be sending nude photos of herself to strange men via snapchat. She told police she ran away because our neighbor had sexually assaulted her. This time prosecutors spoke with the child and told her they believed her to be lying and would be looking for evidence to prove this, after which she would be facing charges. This was due to the neighbor in question being a well known spokesperson for out local LGBTQ+ organization who has had a very public same sex relationship for over a decade. No actual charges were filed against her however as the neighbor declined to assist in their investigation against the girl. After this she began threatening the younger children in the household,  physically attacking them, pushing the youngest down stairs and gleefully telling me about very detailed dreams of her killing me. We had to install audio monitors in areas of the home to ensure the safety of the younger children. We continued to seek mental health help for her, realizing something was fundamentally wrong with her. Yes, it took this long. About 3.5 years. Because believe it or not, we wanted to have faith in her. We believed we could help her. She ran away again, was gone for 4 days, and when located was wearing mens clothing. She was 75 miles away from home. And covered in fresh self harm. She was also located with a stolen cell phone which she was on kik, snapchat and reddit looking for strangers to pick her up. We immediately took her to the local hospital with mental health admissions.  They sent her home. Two days later I quit my job to homeschool her, and devote more time to her mental health. We installed locks on sharps cabinets.  We removed her access to the internet.  We feared she would become the victim of human trafficking.  I was terrified she would begin accusing my husband of assaulting her and began systematically removing her access to him one on one. For the last 2.5 years I have maintained constant vigilance, employing two family friends to assist when I was unable. We thought the best thing to do was to provide my husband with eyewitness alibis just in case, as he continued to deny that the child was capable of accusing him. This caused many arguments between he and I. But I didn't care. I felt the need to protect him, and now.... well... She began attacking me. Going so far as to bring knives from her mother's and running wildly at me with them. I begged my husband to call the police the last time when she woke us by beating me in the face with a hair curling iron and breaking two of my molars out of my mouth at 1am. I seriously considered leaving him, but also understood that juvie would not get her the help she needs. I redoubled my efforts, going as far as to call several inpatient facilities and beg them to take her for evaluation.  We tried taking her to the hospital again and attempted to sign her in but they refused stating she was not in crisis and there were no beds. Life continued for another four months.

Very beginning of 2019 she ran away again.  Police were called, again. And at 3am they were pounding on our door stating the child was accusing my husband of rape. 

We hired a lawyer, begged CPS to place the child in a state run home as the mother is unfit, and so our fresh new hell began. Granted it wasn't all bad prior, those stories are just highlights. Anyway. So CPS obviously places her with her mother in an overstuffed trailer.  The police begin demanding a polygraph from my husband, but here's a little known fact. Poly graph tests CANNOT be done on someone with certain anxiety disorders because their heart rates are irregular and often high, leading to hard to determine results if not unreadable. People who have panic attacks often breathe too deep for these tests to be accurate. AND they are not usable in court. So now it has been THREE months since the  initial allegations and we still have no idea if there will be charges pressed. While we know the police know her history this has not stopped CPS from harassing my children at school, going so far as to tell a 10 year old girl that her father will be imprisoned,  or that she will be going to foster care as her mother is standing with her father and refuses to believe she married a rapist. No dice, my 10 year old came home and told me CPS told her that her father is a rapist. Also we have no idea what the allegations are except ""Child sexually abusive conduct"". This can range so far... and I get it, there will be people that are going to rail at me for not believing her, or for standing up for him. But we tried. For so long. We gave her every opportunity,  we tried to give her a better life. She is so manipulative,  and learned so young how to get her way... 

And now my world falls to pieces, my children cry daily, not knowing when CPS or the police are going to barge in and seperate our family. The life we worked so hard for is in shambles. Two low class kids who fought and struggled for years, going into debt to get higher education, each working 50 hour weeks while raising toddlers and going to college, living in a third floor walk up 1 bedroom apartment and saving every last penny for downpayment on our home, finally getting jobs in our chosen professions and making small dents in our student debt. Working together for 13 years to become more than our birthplace could give.... until we could finally close on a nice family home. Finally bought a vehicle. Finally stopped using the local food bank as our main source of feeding the family. The last 7 years we really thought we had pulled ourselves out. No longer have to look over our shoulders for the next pile of shit to hit the fan. No longer planning every meal around cheap rice and canned beans because fresh meat or veggies were too expensive.  Able to take vacation time and give the kids some joy in the summer. And knowing we fought so hard together.  That our love strengthened with every hard ship. Being able to look at each other and know our plans were coming to fruition...

It's all falling apart. I haven't felt this out of control of my life since before I met him. When I was homeless and hungry at 16. He's never spoken about his suicide attempt before, just saying that life was hard when he was a teenager. Now he's told me he has a plan. My kids cry every night, they hug him so hard before bed, and again before school in the morning. They are terrified the girl will come back and try to harm them. He's thrown himself into work, working 70 or 80 hours a week, trying to finish seasonal work in case he is arrested while living in fear that he will be arrested at work. I'm trying to hold it together but failing miserably.  And to add to all of this, in the last week I've lost two extended family member whom I was close to, to cancer. My father is Ill and relies on me for transportation to and from doctors visits. And every night I go to bed holding my husband close, wishing he sleeps before the tears come, while I wonder what I will tell the kids if he is arrested tomorrow.  How will we go on? And what if they really do take my kids from me as well? Should I pack their favorite things now so that they don't have 5 minutes with a cop and a garbage bag while mom is in handcuffs downstairs like what happened to me when I was 8? How do people go on after losing their entire soul? Is this even real? Is this all just some figment of my imagination, some slow burn my mind has created so that when I wake from this nightmare I have some kind of acceptance of the loss? Am I dead? Did she actually kill me and now I'm in hell? Why does food all taste like chalk? Why is it water no longer quenches thirst? And worst of all, am I making a mistake? Is there any way there was enough alone time for something to have actually happened? Am I potentially putting my children at risk because I am not strong enough to leave? CPS hasn't told us to separate but they hint that a separation order is coming every week. Should I just take the kids to his mom's now? Am I holding my husband for the last time? Am I holding a child abuser? My soul is the three of them. My reason for living is the three of them. My motivation to become a better person every single day is the three of them. I cannot live for myself. I hate myself to the deepest depths of my being. I'm fat, I'm a slob, I'm too anxious, too ugly, too stupid. But they see parts of me they enjoy, beyond my own understanding.  And for them I will live, nurture the artistic, nerdy, socially awkward fat ass that I am. Because they make me better. I struggle less with body image. Haven't contemplated suicide in a decade. Because if they can love me I MUST be worthy of that love. So I work daily to be worthy of that love. But am I? Have I sinned so badly in the past that Karma is finally dropping me to rock bottom? 

And all of this while the girl child runs wild at its mother's.  While she calls the home phone and threatens to burn the house down. While she posts her sexual exploits publically online,  along with her underage smoking and drinking. And CPS does nothing except make our lives hell. 

So there. I've vented. Welcome to my hell. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this is not the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; place. &lt;/p&gt;

This never happened and instead he moved into the room I love the most and would spend a lot off time with my other uncle upstairs, on his first day he did the thing Iv been wanting to do for a long time sleep round that house as it has WiFi.

He now sleeps till 1:00pm and wakes up and goes on my PS4 I tend to wait for him to come round great nans as that’s where I’m sleeping or I go round there and he’s either a sleep or on the PS4. I waist so much off the day waiting for him to wake up. 

My uncles best friend comes round a lot and actually thinks I’m alright him and my uncle wants me to sit with them and have a laugh but they smoke weed and although I’ve given my uncle money for weed I still didn’t want any, but because off the weed my cousin (who used to smoke a lot in Scotland) sits with them haves a few puffs then either sits with them having a laugh or go’s down stairs with me.

I sit downstairs as my uncle told him too because me being down there might get him to go down as he’s told me he doesn’t want him upstairs, I confessed I know and said Iv always tried to keep my distance from u and ur mate as he’s ur friend not mine and he told me no he wants me up there he spoke to him before about me and they both said it was fine.

Makes me a bit upset knowing they actually want me there but pretend to kick me downstairs meaning my cousin too but he ignores it making me look like the annoying youngest, as I’m 15 and the youngest my cousin is 16 and uncle 37ish.

My own room at my mums house as that’s where I am on school days as I have to get a taxi to school (I was kicked out) and there is no WiFi at my mums and the tv doesn’t always work meaning I have to sit in my room all day and wen I’m excluded for the day i wake up go back to sleep and wait till I get dinner or if it gets to 10:30pm and go’s to sleep.

I know this isn't anything compared to others here, my situation could always be worse. But oh well, vent I will anyways. 

First off, I'm 19. I live in a crappy depressed town full of heroin addicts and low paying jobs. There's nothing to do around here; it's boring as hell and none of my friends live nearby. I grew up very lonely, and while I do have friends now, they're all a distance away and mostly hang around with each other, since they live near each other. I only get to see them once every month or two if I'm lucky. I can't drive, my parents can't afford it and neither can I. My life is like groundhog day, I work, I sleep in, end the night by watching Netflix/Hulu alone and always play video games alone because none of my other friends do. My best friend lives 6 hours away so it's not like we can hang out as much as we'd like.

I just get so hurt looking at my other young friends' lives and it's incredibly frustrating. There's so many things I want to do. I want to travel, I want to get out of this dumpy small town and go somewhere better; live my life and feel genuinely fulfilled. I want friends I can actually hang out with on a regular basis. I want to feel love; I want to feel the essence of life itself. The stuff that makes your soul feel real. They've had all these things handed to them all their lives. No one gets it. No one understands what it's like to be alone (minus my family ofc) all the time and have to try and entertain yourself because there's nothing interesting around you. I just wish I could have what seems to be the basics and comes easily for so many others. Some of my friends have cars and drive because their parents do everything for them. I'm not spoiled like that, nor can I be, for that matter.

I'm so afraid of life continuing like this and I desperately want some excitement. I've got goals I'm working towards; perhaps that'll be the change I'm looking for. People always say ""appreciate what you have."" And I do. The thing is, that statement annoys me because it insinuates I don't. Things could be worse, yes. I appreciate my friends and family and life in general. But there's also basic things that I want from life and want to change. Sometimes I wish I could cut the cord to my emotions so I could forget the pain. Am I asking too much for my existence? I don't know. I just don't want my youth to pass me by and be completely out of my control. 

Anyways, that's all for my rant. I'm doing this just to get it off my chest. I'm not depressed or suicidal, just extremely frustrated with my current place and life and really hoping the future turns in my favour, that one day the tables will turn and maybe those people who are always in their own little cliques will understand the pain of being alone. Then again, I can't bring myself to truly wish it upon anyone. Oh well. Goodnight Reddit, and thank you. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway here.

2 weeks ago, a couple guys in my class (We're automotive students at a trades school in Chilliwack, British Columbia) were driving to school in the morning. We had some snow in days prior so roads were a bit slick. They was driving in a 60 km/h zone with deep ditches on either side, and the person in front of him was doing 40, presumably due to road conditions. Kyle, the driver, got impatient and decided to overtake, ended up going quite a bit over 60. When he got back into the right lane, he started to fishtail. He lost control and went into the ditch, ending up flipped over on the roof of the car. Kyle was knocked unconscious, with his head in the water. His passenger somehow ended up in the backseat and was unable to get out, but wasn't hurt. ""I'm cold, but I'm OK"" is apparently what he said. Thank goodness there were two other cars with four more students from our class right behind them. They all jumped into the ditch and got right to work trying to get the two of them out. There were also 2 more bystanders who jumped into action, one of them on his way to fish in a nearby river so he had waders on. Anyway, they managed to get both of them out of the car, but Kyle only briefly regained consciousness to let out a few screams of pain and cough up some dirty ditch water. Both of them were taken to hospital immediately. Kyle's passenger was released later on the same day with no serious injuries, but Kyle himself wasn't so lucky. He had a broken leg, all of his ribs broken, and both lungs punctured. He was placed on life support in a medically induced coma. Complication after complication kept coming up, including massive infection in his lungs due to the aforementioned dirty ditch water, and the doctors just couldn't get him to breathe on his own. Kyle passed away in hospital yesterday, Sunday March 3rd, at the age of just 17. 

I barely knew Kyle, only known he existed since the school year began in September, and only talked to him on a couple occasions since then. But regardless of that, getting that news this morning hit me like a freight train. It didn't feel real until I walked into class and saw Kyle's best friend sitting at his desk, face buried in his arms, shuddering. If I'm as shaken as I am with only knowing him five months, I can't even imagine what it's like for the best friend he's had since middle school, let alone his family and girlfriend.

Kyle had a very bright future ahead of him that he now won't get live out. All because of one poor decision on a slippery road. 

We haven't been given details on a funeral yet, but assuming his family wants his classmates there, I will most definitely be attending to show my support for Kyle's family.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of what you&amp;#39;re about to read is a secondhand recounting of what I&amp;#39;ve been told by others.

Well after I completed all my work and I went to play and I got told by admin that I’m not allowed to play because my grade have to be good by the end of the first semester. So I was lied to and ripped of my first year of being on a lacrosse team.  Well it’s my 3 year playing now and my coach is having me play a couple varsity games and all JV games but yet I am much better then all of the people on the varsity team. Well my girlfriend tried to get in the girls lacrosse team and didn’t make it because she well... isn’t good enough it’s just plain and simple all throughout the summer I tried to get her to practice with me and she wouldn’t and it showed at her try outs. Now the other day I was at a game and a player took his mouth guard out and gave it to me and said “watch this” so I handed it to my coach and said it was “persons” mouth guard. So coach called a time out and yelled at the kid and suspended the kid from the game for not wearing a mouth guard- after our coach constantly says “WEAR A MOUTH GUARD” so my girlfriend thinks I’m wrong for telling coach he didn’t have one in. But if the ref found out he didn’t have a mouth guard in the school is fined and we get a player penalty was I in the wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

Also, sorry for any grammatical mistakes or parts of the story that may not make sense because I didn't explain them correctly ahead of time.

Jumping right into it, I'm taking a communications class. We work in groups and get judged as a group for the class. Well, we have this project due. I won't bore you with the details, but we had to choose groups. My original group was too big so the professor asked one of us to volunteer to be apart of another group with smaller numbers. No one wanted to and for good reason now that I look back on it. I don't like to be a judgmental person, so I decided to give the group a chance, but some of the girls in my new group garnered a reputation for being stupid assholes to everyone. Silly me thought that it would change because this project is such a big part of our grade and they would try to get along, but I was wrong. I choose the wrong group to be apart of.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first met them, I had gotten bad feelings from two of the girls. We'll refer to these two girls as R and N. Well, the first time we ever had a meeting for our group, we met at Starbucks. As were discussing what our roles in the group would be, R brings up the ""asshole dude"" from class to the other girl N. Apparently, he was an asshole because he was being upfront about the days he could and could not meet up, and that it would be better if he found another group. Big mistake on his part because now they blatantly shout ""Where's so and so, the asshole dude?"" in class. I happen to know this guy. I sit next to him and we chat during class. He has two jobs and goes to school full time. He has his plate full. I didn't think he was being an asshole, if anything, he was being honest and it would've saved them from any sort of predicament. R and N didn't see it this way, and when I defended ""asshole dude,"" they looked at me like I was some sort of alien freak. God forbid I didn't want to talk shit about him. That should've been my warning sign, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

A week passes, and the prof gives us an assignment to complete after taking an exam. We were free to leave after the exam, but she encouraged us to complete the assignment since everyone was already there in class. I remember just wanting to sleep and go home. Turns out I had a fever and was out for 3 days, but that's besides the point. After taking the exam I text in the group chat that I'm feeling horrible and will be going home. No response. Instead, R and N text each other and are talking about how they are going to go ahead and complete the assignment with only 3 people present: R, N, and B. (Its a group of 5 and me and another girl, G, had our own separate reasons for leaving early that day). Turns out, the only thing they decided was that they wanted our group project to be about Mean Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

A day or two later, the girls are trying to set up another meeting, but instead of referring to this worksheet where everyone's availability hours are posted, they schedule the meeting when me and G are in class. When they ask for my availability, I text the wrong day and time because I was thinking about my schedule for a different day. I correct myself, and R accuses me of changing my schedule and how its causing confusion and chaos????? Like, wtf? I let it pass because I'm not a confrontational person until I have to be. R and N complain about how not everyone is making an effort to be at the meetings, but seriously? I have class AND you have a piece of paper that tells you EVERYONE'S schedule. I tell them that its no big deal, that I will go after my class so that they can catch me up and not miss anything, but G is stuck in class all day and can't make it. Again. They do not respond directly to me and continue on with their conversations.

A day passes and G mentions that its unfair that they planned a meeting where two people can't join and G actually looks at the worksheet where we filled out our schedules and sees when everyone is available. She tells everyone to meet up on Wednesday at 4, because everyone has free time that day. N says that its too last minute and can't because she was gonna go with her family somewhere. R says she can't because she has class at 6. B (the other girl in my group) says she can't either because she was scheduled for work. I tell her that as soon as I'm done with class that I would go and meet up at 4:15. She reprimands everyone else for not putting more effort and time into our project. R ends up agreeing with her and says she will go to the meeting. It's just 3 of us, we talk and discuss more details. I also go to R and N's meeting the next day and discuss details with the group as soon as I got out of class. Only G wasn't able to make it to that one.

&amp;#x200B;

Then class rolls along again and G mentions that it seems that everyone is always busy during the week so that we should meet up on Saturday because no one has trouble going on Saturday. I agree automatically because I know my weekends are free all day. We ALL agree on the time and place. Saturday comes along. It's almost our meet up time. G is making sure that everyone will be going. R is being a cynic and being uncooperative. R says she doesn't even know what we'd be meeting about. I tell her that according to the syllabus we should be writing our skit at this time. I don't know what the hell kind of thing I did for her to be a b\*\*\*h to me, but she says, ""Yea but y'all never come so how can we meet up when it only me and G and N always trying and u and B always somehow can't make it."" I make it abundantly clear that I have a certain schedule and that I try my hardest to work with everyone else's schedule, even getting out of class a little early so that I have more time to be with the group. R ignores my response. Doesn't even mention it. R says she isn't going because she's sick, supposedly, and writes about how it's ""really annoying,"" that we can't all meet at the time she wants to and starts spouting nonsense about how we should take things seriously. She also makes it explicitly clear that she won't go Thursday or Tuesday because she has sh\*t to do. N decides that it's too last minute and she had chores to do, but also wants to throw me and B under the bus, but says, ""I'm not saying this is in a negative way but you know i'll show up any other day."" B says she has to go to Tijuana. I was the only one still wanting to meet up. Because of everyone's lack of effort, G gets really mad. She chews out N for her bullsh\*t reasons and tells R that regardless of meeting, we should be doing things on our own too because its a GROUP project. EVERYONE agreed to meet on Saturday, but they all bailed. She decides to text everyone individually. She tells me that the meeting is postponed but she's gonna talk to the rest of the group and she'd keep me posted. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm freaking livid. I can't understand how someone could be so rude, dense, and dim all at once???? Like, R and N are basically spouting about how reliable they are, but the one time everyone could meet, they bail, and for oddly convenient reasons?????? And another thing, they all have my schedule so it should come to no surprise that I can't make it at a meeting they decide to make during my class time?????? Like how dim must you be to blame other people for your lack of commitment???? Legit, the only time work got done for the project was when me and G got together that day, R just happened to be there. It took R, N, and B 3 hours to come up with a concept, but me and G solidified details, characters, motivations, and story in a 2 hour sitting????????? And another thing, how can you say i never make it to the meetings when, news flash, I only missed one? All they did was come up with how they wanted to do a skit based on Mean Girls the day I missed. I am trying my hardest to work around their attitudes and get things done, but god, how the hell am I supposed to deal with such negative people? I had to hold myself back so much not to tear R's head off. I want to say so many horrible things to her, but this is my grade. I take school very seriously. I'm passing with all A's in my 4 classes and she's spouting about my lack of commitment to the group?????? Sure, I can't make it when SHE wants me to, but then again, why does it always have to be when she wants us to?????? She has no right to complain that we have different schedules. Not to mention,  I'm guessing the only reason she's freaking out now is because she's a sh\*tty student. She failed both exams we took, she failed all her quizzes up until now, and the day of class, Friday, when we set a meeting for Saturday, the prof surprises us with a quiz we have to take as a group. Guess what people were completely uncooperative and guess which people basically took that test for the group? If you guess R and N as being uncooperative you were correct, and if you guess me and G as being the test takers for the groups, you're also correct and deserve a gold star. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there is anyone still reading this, what is your advice? Do you think that I'm in the wrong? Should I be doing more to help the group out? How do you deal with immature people willing to throw people under the bus? Should I confront her? Any advice is appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today has got to be one of the most stupidest days I&amp;#39;ve had in a long time. Also, sorry for any grammatical mistakes or parts of the story that may not make sense because I didn&amp;#39;t explain them correctly ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping right into it, I&amp;#39;m taking a communications class. We work in groups and get judged as a group for the class. Well, we have this project due. I won&amp;#39;t bore you with the details, but we had to choose groups. My original group was too big so the professor asked one of us to volunteer to be apart of another group with smaller numbers. No one wanted to and for good reason now that I look back on it. I don&amp;#39;t like to be a judgmental person, so I decided to give the group a chance, but some of the girls in my new group garnered a reputation for being stupid assholes to everyone. Silly me thought that it would change because this project is such a big part of our grade and they would try to get along, but I was wrong. I choose the wrong group to be apart of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first met them, I had gotten bad feelings from two of the girls. We&amp;#39;ll refer to these two girls as R and N. Well, the first time we ever had a meeting for our group, we met at Starbucks. As were discussing what our roles in the group would be, R brings up the &amp;quot;asshole dude&amp;quot; from class to the other girl N. Apparently, he was an asshole because he was being upfront about the days he could and could not meet up, and that it would be better if he found another group. Big mistake on his part because now they blatantly shout &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s so and so, the asshole dude?&amp;quot; in class. I happen to know this guy. I sit next to him and we chat during class. He has two jobs and goes to school full time. He has his plate full. I didn&amp;#39;t think he was being an asshole, if anything, he was being honest and it would&amp;#39;ve saved them from any sort of predicament. R and N didn&amp;#39;t see it this way, and when I defended &amp;quot;asshole dude,&amp;quot; they looked at me like I was some sort of alien freak. God forbid I didn&amp;#39;t want to talk shit about him. That should&amp;#39;ve been my warning sign, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week passes, and the prof gives us an assignment to complete after taking an exam. We were free to leave after the exam, but she encouraged us to complete the assignment since everyone was already there in class. I remember just wanting to sleep and go home. Turns out I had a fever and was out for 3 days, but that&amp;#39;s besides the point. After taking the exam I text in the group chat that I&amp;#39;m feeling horrible and will be going home. No response. Instead, R and N text each other and are talking about how they are going to go ahead and complete the assignment with only 3 people present: R, N, and B. (Its a group of 5 and me and another girl, G, had our own separate reasons for leaving early that day). Turns out, the only thing they decided was that they wanted our group project to be about Mean Girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day or two later, the girls are trying to set up another meeting, but instead of referring to this worksheet where everyone&amp;#39;s availability hours are posted, they schedule the meeting when me and G are in class. When they ask for my availability, I text the wrong day and time because I was thinking about my schedule for a different day. I correct myself, and R accuses me of changing my schedule and how its causing confusion and chaos????? Like, wtf? I let it pass because I&amp;#39;m not a confrontational person until I have to be. R and N complain about how not everyone is making an effort to be at the meetings, but seriously? I have class AND you have a piece of paper that tells you EVERYONE&amp;#39;S schedule. I tell them that its no big deal, that I will go after my class so that they can catch me up and not miss anything, but G is stuck in class all day and can&amp;#39;t make it. Again. They do not respond directly to me and continue on with their conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day passes and G mentions that its unfair that they planned a meeting where two people can&amp;#39;t join and G actually looks at the worksheet where we filled out our schedules and sees when everyone is available.

To make matters worse, all the cute boys that do exists are always gay! Not that I hate gay people, but because I'm straight, I don't enjoy gay shit and that makes my chances of finding a boy like me super low! I just want a cute guy friend to talk and cuddle with and not be considered gay! And another thing: There is this huge double standard in society that irks me to no end. Women are allowed to have deep, emotional, even cuddly friendships together, and people not only think that it's not gay, but also encourage it. Not that I don't, but the second guys are slightly friendly, it's ""gay"" and that's bad. Can't society just accept us for who we are?!?!

I also crave a romantic friendship really badly, and I don't really care about gender, as long as they love me for who I am. No sex, no dating, just cuddles. I'd even co-sleep with another male as long as I know them well, they're around my age, and if they're kind, beautiful, sweet, or cute enough. Don't get me wrong, I am not attracted in any way towards normal guys, but if they look act or think more like me and/or are really friendly, then I really like them. Nonsexually tho.

My stance on the whole thing is that why push away people that give affection and cuddles for free even if they are your gender? It's an offer I could never refuse!

I will say it probably started about two years ago when my then wife started changing. I am a stay at home dad but I made more money than she did working. I paid all the bills in the house, including her car payment, insurance, and other related items that had nothing to do with me. Summer breaks I would watch the kids while she was at work. They had chores to do to “pay” for their internet, cable, and phones. Plus it helps the kids learn how to keep house. My son from another woman would come over for dinner at night before he would go to work. We made more than enough for an extra person to eat. In fact her family would show up more to eat dinner than my son would. One day she asked my adult son what he spends his money on and why he could buy his own dinner. He told her what he did with his money was none of her business. She then told my son to get the fuck out of the house and he wasn’t allowed to eat dinner at her house anymore. At this point I said, this is OUR house and he is more than welcome to eat here every night no matter how much money he makes. That pissed my wife off immensely. I love all my children. They all deserve a warm meal. And a safe place to go. And I was trying to provide that and she took that from me. Shortly after this went down she told me to start sleeping on the couch because she couldn’t get to sleep with my snoring, and my CPAP machine made too much noise. So I started sleeping on the couch. I was still paying the bills, helping the kids with the chores, cooking, and anything I could to make sure she could come home from work and just sit down and relax. However she wouldn’t converse with me. She would come in from work and get on her phone and not put it down until supper was ready, and then go straight to the bedroom where she would pick it back up again until she went to bed. I got told the tv was too loud in the living room and causing her problems with getting to sleep, and since she was the only one that worked around here everything should be turned off when she went to bed. So I bought a pair of headphones that plug into the tv so I could turn up the volume on them and not disturb her. This went on for about three months. That’s when our nephew got really sick. She would drive an hour and a half to see him one way, leave me and the other two kids at home. I would make sure dinner was made for them, the house was clean, laundry was done. I would make her a plate and keep it for her. She would come in from being gone for four-five hours and go straight to bed. Once my nephew was discharged from the hospital he came home with my wife. Now this is where it all starts to get very bad. She told me in no uncertain terms that she was taking custody of our nephew and she didn’t give a fuck what my opinion was. I said, out of everyone on earth my opinion should matter the most, and I am paying the bills so please give me the respect to ask my opinion. She said she didn’t care what my opinion was and that it was final. My opinion would have been, we need to keep him at our house to keep him well. Both of his parents were into meth and it wasn’t a good situation for him to be in anyways. But she didn’t care about my opinion. At that point I told her that I did everything for her and would ask her opinion because I value her opinion above all others. She still didn’t care. Wouldn’t even ask. She told me I was there to pay the bills, and clean the house and to stop making her kids do chores. I said they do their chores to get their internet, cable, TVs and the fun stuff I pay for monthly. She told me she didn’t care that I was just here to pay the bills and they weren’t my kids and to not talk to them anymore and they wouldn’t be doing anything I asked anymore. Now, these kids are not mine biologically but they are mine 100%. I love them. So when she told me they weren’t my kids and told them they weren’t allowed to talk to me anymore I was done. On October 6th of 2017 I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She told me to pack my shit and get out. I asked her how she was going to afford the house payment, the car payment, the insurance on both, phones, electric and take care of the kids and pets. She said she didn’t care what happened but she wanted me out of the house. I said this is my house as much as it is yours however you cannot afford it and you know it. That’s when I saw the real person I had married 8 years earlier.  I have never raised a hand to her. If we fought we did it away from the kids. I tried my hardest to never raise my voice at her however sometimes I was unsuccessful. She told me she was going to get a protection order and have me removed from the property. I said on what grounds? I have never threatened you or was ever violent with you. She then said she would lie and they would believe her because she was the woman. We had three German Shepherds and I asked when you do this they are coming with me, and she said no they aren’t, I am going to give them away while you are banned from coming here. Now these dogs aren’t just dogs to me. They are my children. I love my animals. I was taught growing up if you got an animal you never ever got rid of it. You kept that animal for the entirety of its life. She was hitting me where it hurt. When I told her I wanted a divorce I told her she didn’t need to move out until she found a place that she could afford and was more than welcome to stay as long as she needed to. I started changing everything into my name for bills for the house because she told me she was going to have the power turned off because it was in her name. She turned off the credit card that was in our names at the bank but expected me to pay the remaining balance because I made more money even though she used it to buy a new iPad less than two months earlier. I had started recording our conversations because I needed to show proof she was lying if she served me a protective order. She had places to go that would have taken her and the kids but I had no where to go with my three dogs. So for the next three weeks I was cleaning the house, paying bills. Had nothing to eat because she would make the kids dinner and then throw away the left overs so I couldn’t eat her food. Thank God my sister is a saint or I wouldn’t have made it. Her mother called me and told me the kids weren’t mine, and to get my fat lazy worthless piece of shit ass off the couch and get a job. Mind you I make enough to pay every bill in the house from home but that wasn’t good enough for her. On October 26th she finally moved out. I was told not to have any contact with the children at all or she would involve the law. But I made sure her bills were paid for three months so she could get on her feet. Including paying for the cell phones for my children so we could talk. She found out and told me she wouldn’t allow me to talk to her children and I should have thought about that when I told her I wanted a divorce. So I had to shut off my kids phones. And January I stopped paying her bills completely. It’s been a year since I have paid a bill for her, but she asks me to pay a bill here and there for her if she can’t. I paid for her new glasses that she needed because she couldn’t afford them almost a year after we separated. She has let me see the kids, unless she gets mad then she takes them away from me. Being a step parent I have no rights to them but I keep insurance on them so they can go to the doctor. Their real fathers don’t keep insurance on them so I make sure they have insurance. Currently anytime the kids don’t listen to her she calls me because they respect me and will listen to me. She cooks them dinner after she gets off work and goes to the bar with her boyfriend and then sleeps at his house before getting up and going home to get ready for work and getting the kids up for school. My nephew and son have both been smoking weed. Skipping school. Drinking. And I can’t do anything about it because I am just a step parent and have no rights to them. The police say what she is doing isn’t illegal. So I have to just take what time I can with them and let them know I will always be there for them. Even if they didn’t come from me they are still my kids. Now that’s just one part of my life I am dealing with. On to the next. 


         On December 2nd 2017 my father fell and broke his neck, and wrist coming up the stairs from his basement. On December 5th my father fell again, this time at the hospital, and broke his hip. He was rushed from our small hospital to the main trauma hospital in the state where he underwent a very risky surgery to replace his broken hip. Now my father was is congestive heart failure stage 4 when they operated on him. He had a pacemaker/defibrillator implanted about ten years earlier and his cardiologist told him he would never survive any surgery after that one. Well my father proved him wrong and made it through. He was sent to the local rehabilitation facility after a week in ICU to begin to learn to walk again. It was very hard to see the greatest man I ever knew, in a wheelchair, neck brace and cast on his wrist.  My father was discharged after completing rehabilitation on February 21st. Where he was sent home to get better.  Now I am a twin, and we were born on my fathers birthday. So that was coming up. Ok, on to the next issue of this is my fucked up life.

        In May of 2016 my mothers sister moved back to Iowa. My mother had died back in 2011, so when my aunt showed up it was like getting a piece of my mom back again and it was awesome. Her health wasn’t the greatest when she moved back but she thought she was getting better. On December 22nd of 2017 my aunt was rushed by ambulance to the hospital where she never left. My aunt died on January 3rd. We had grown to be such good friends in the last year and a half it was hard enough, but because she was so like my mother in so many ways, it was like losing my mom and aunt at the same time. I couldn’t handle all the stuff going on in my life at this point. I was more stressed than I had ever been and was just praying for a reprieve. What I didn’t know is life is cruel as fuck. And there is no reprieve when that’s the only thing you want. 

       So, wife and I split October, Dad fell December, Aunt died January. We are all caught up because this next paragraph is gonna suck worse than the last three. March was a slow month however that was life just getting warmed up to fuck my world up worse than I ever could have imagined. Somehow around my birthday(my fathers and sisters as well) I contracted a very communicable virus. My fathers 80th birthday couldn’t have been worse. That was the day neither I, nor my twin, could get to see him, and he found out he had Stage 4 small cell lung cancer. The doctor told him he had less than 6 months and to get his affairs in order. Happy fucking birthday dad, you’re gonna die soon and I can’t even be there to celebrate our last birthday together. My father didnt last 3 months. He died in his house on June 9th. How low can you go you say? Trust me, it can get lower. And it is going to by the time I am done typing this out. The man who taught me how to me a man is dead. My safety net. The one I could always turn to no matter what is now gone. So what do I do? Drugs. For two months I was either drunk or on some sort of benzodiazepine. The middle of August I started coming out of it finally. Not needing a drink to numb myself. Not needing a pill to stop the tears. Here come the shitty paragraph.

    I will never forget the date. I will never forget it was sunny out, it wasn’t hot but it wasn’t cool. Two weeks earlier my daughter had told me she was pregnant. And things were starting to look up. But don’t let that fool you, because the other shoe was about to drop, and it was gonna fucking dropkick me in the face and then fuck my life up worse than it already was. August 22nd was the date. I got a phone call from my daughter who was bawling to the point I couldn’t understand her. She finally calmed down enough to tell me to meet her at the ER as she thought she was having a miscarriage. I was devastated. So I hurry up and get dressed with whatever was closest, and make sure the dogs had what they needed and I ran out the door. At the hospital they did all the tests, bloodwork and everything. She didn’t have a miscarriage. But she was told not to do anything stressful that day and to go home and rest. We walked outside of the hospital and she said she was hungry. While discussing where to eat, I received a phone call from my sister telling me my house was on fire and it was on the news. I laughed it off, whatever my house isn’t on fire. That’s when I started getting msgs on Facebook and texts and another phone call while my sister was telling me to get my ass home that it was on fire.  Someone once asked me if there was a time I knew my life had changed and would never be the same. Turning down my street and seeing the smoke, the fire trucks, the cops, the ambulance is when I knew my life was over as I knew it. I ran up to the house to ask about my dogs and the fire chief told me the dogs had gotten out, and I said where are the three German Shepherds? He said no the little black dog and the little white dog got out. I then said, there is three German Shepherd’s in that house. There isn’t many places for them to hide, find my fucking dogs. And I waited. And waited. And waited. I have no idea how long it took before they finally found my  three full grow German Shepherds hiding under my bed but one came running out and as soon as I called his name he came straight to me.  Less than thirty seconds later, the other two came running out almost together. So we load up dogs and head to the vet clinic. Put them in the caged, told them I loved them and I would be back. And went back to my house. Now to find my cats.  The fire department told us we could stay on the south side, but not to go to the north side because they were making sure it wasn’t going to flare up again. We found four cats almost immediately. Took them to the vet clinic. All animals were seen by the vet, dogs had smoke inhalation, one cat had it as well. The vet told me the cat probably wouldn’t make it but he would try his hardest. Still missing one cat, I had so many phone calls to make. My insurance company, Red Cross, utility’s. I smelled like smoke, had no clothes but what on my back. I was able to sleep in a friends apartment. Where I took a shower went to bed to wake up and put the same clothes on. Headed straight to the house, and found the last cat completely unharmed. However, someone had broken in during the night and stole God knows what. So the last cat goes to the vet.  September 1st I was able to get my dogs out of the vet and take them to a temporary home. The next day or the day after the cats went to my sons house to stay until the insurance company decided what to do. My house was broken into no less than three times. And I still don’t know what is missing. The insurance adjuster said my house was salvageable and to find a contractor as soon as possible.  Three days after the fire, the fire inspector told me what started the fire. It was a floor lamp I had bought at Walmart 7 years earlier. No foul play. So I hire a contractor to fix my shit. He said, we will have you in your house by Thanksgiving. I moved back into my house January 24th. Now I was renting to own at this point. So the landlord said I had to get the house in my name immediately. So I figure the house will appraise at way more than what I needed to pay the landlord. So I go to the bank. The house appraised at $65,000 and I needed $38,000. However they wanted 20% down. $7,000. After I had lost everything in the fire. The 29th of January I was served with the right to cure papers. This is after I paid them $17,000 on the price of the house, my insurance company did $55,000 worth of work, and I did countless repairs to make the house better. I’m getting evicted from my house, and no one will rent to me because I have pets. So I call the VA because they help homeless veterans. Their answer to my question was, get rid of your pets. We don’t care about your pets. Honestly that’s what I was told. And we wonder why 22 veterans a day take their own life. So this is my vent. I will be kicked out of my house that I have paid more than $20,000 on and they will get to sell it for $65,000 and make bank because I paid for the insurance and paid the contractor to do work on a house that was taken out from under me as soon as they could. I have quit asking what more could go wrong because I’m afraid life will show me something worse than I have been through. 



TL;DR divorce, injury, death, more death, Fire, eviction after house is fixed. VA said get rid of your pets before we can help you.

They had chores to do to “pay” for their internet, cable, and phones. Plus it helps the kids learn how to keep house. My son from another woman would come over for dinner at night before he would go to work. We made more than enough for an extra person to eat. In fact her family would show up more to eat dinner than my son would. One day she asked my adult son what he spends his money on and why he could buy his own dinner. He told her what he did with his money was none of her business. She then told my son to get the fuck out of the house and he wasn’t allowed to eat dinner at her house anymore. At this point I said, this is OUR house and he is more than welcome to eat here every night no matter how much money he makes. That pissed my wife off immensely. I love all my children. They all deserve a warm meal. And a safe place to go. And I was trying to provide that and she took that from me. Shortly after this went down she told me to start sleeping on the couch because she couldn’t get to sleep with my snoring, and my CPAP machine made too much noise. So I started sleeping on the couch. I was still paying the bills, helping the kids with the chores, cooking, and anything I could to make sure she could come home from work and just sit down and relax. However she wouldn’t converse with me. She would come in from work and get on her phone and not put it down until supper was ready, and then go straight to the bedroom where she would pick it back up again until she went to bed. I got told the tv was too loud in the living room and causing her problems with getting to sleep, and since she was the only one that worked around here everything should be turned off when she went to bed. So I bought a pair of headphones that plug into the tv so I could turn up the volume on them and not disturb her. This went on for about three months. That’s when our nephew got really sick. She would drive an hour and a half to see him one way, leave me and the other two kids at home. I would make sure dinner was made for them, the house was clean, laundry was done. I would make her a plate and keep it for her. She would come in from being gone for four-five hours and go straight to bed. Once my nephew was discharged from the hospital he came home with my wife. Now this is where it all starts to get very bad. She told me in no uncertain terms that she was taking custody of our nephew and she didn’t give a fuck what my opinion was. I said, out of everyone on earth my opinion should matter the most, and I am paying the bills so please give me the respect to ask my opinion. She said she didn’t care what my opinion was and that it was final. My opinion would have been, we need to keep him at our house to keep him well. Both of his parents were into meth and it wasn’t a good situation for him to be in anyways. But she didn’t care about my opinion. At that point I told her that I did everything for her and would ask her opinion because I value her opinion above all others. She still didn’t care. Wouldn’t even ask. She told me I was there to pay the bills, and clean the house and to stop making her kids do chores. I said they do their chores to get their internet, cable, TVs and the fun stuff I pay for monthly. She told me she didn’t care that I was just here to pay the bills and they weren’t my kids and to not talk to them anymore and they wouldn’t be doing anything I asked anymore. Now, these kids are not mine biologically but they are mine 100%. I love them. So when she told me they weren’t my kids and told them they weren’t allowed to talk to me anymore I was done. On October 6th of 2017 I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She told me to pack my shit and get out. I asked her how she was going to afford the house payment, the car payment, the insurance on both, phones, electric and take care of the kids and pets. She said she didn’t care what happened but she wanted me out of the house. I said this is my house as much as it is yours however you cannot afford it and you know it. That’s when I saw the real person I had married 8 years earlier.  I have never raised a hand to her. If we fought we did it away from the kids. I tried my hardest to never raise my voice at her however sometimes I was unsuccessful. She told me she was going to get a protection order and have me removed from the property. I said on what grounds? I have never threatened you or was ever violent with you. She then said she would lie and they would believe her because she was the woman. We had three German Shepherds and I asked when you do this they are coming with me, and she said no they aren’t, I am going to give them away while you are banned from coming here. Now these dogs aren’t just dogs to me. They are my children. I love my animals. I was taught growing up if you got an animal you never ever got rid of it. You kept that animal for the entirety of its life. She was hitting me where it hurt. When I told her I wanted a divorce I told her she didn’t need to move out until she found a place that she could afford and was more than welcome to stay as long as she needed to. I started changing everything into my name for bills for the house because she told me she was going to have the power turned off because it was in her name. She turned off the credit card that was in our names at the bank but expected me to pay the remaining balance because I made more money even though she used it to buy a new iPad less than two months earlier. I had started recording our conversations because I needed to show proof she was lying if she served me a protective order. She had places to go that would have taken her and the kids but I had no where to go with my three dogs. So for the next three weeks I was cleaning the house, paying bills. Had nothing to eat because she would make the kids dinner and then throw away the left overs so I couldn’t eat her food. Thank God my sister is a saint or I wouldn’t have made it. Her mother called me and told me the kids weren’t mine, and to get my fat lazy worthless piece of shit ass off the couch and get a job. Mind you I make enough to pay every bill in the house from home but that wasn’t good enough for her. On October 26th she finally moved out. I was told not to have any contact with the children at all or she would involve the law. But I made sure her bills were paid for three months so she could get on her feet. Including paying for the cell phones for my children so we could talk. She found out and told me she wouldn’t allow me to talk to her children and I should have thought about that when I told her I wanted a divorce. So I had to shut off my kids phones. And January I stopped paying her bills completely. It’s been a year since I have paid a bill for her, but she asks me to pay a bill here and there for her if she can’t. I paid for her new glasses that she needed because she couldn’t afford them almost a year after we separated. She has let me see the kids, unless she gets mad then she takes them away from me. Being a step parent I have no rights to them but I keep insurance on them so they can go to the doctor. Their real fathers don’t keep insurance on them so I make sure they have insurance. Currently anytime the kids don’t listen to her she calls me because they respect me and will listen to me. She cooks them dinner after she gets off work and goes to the bar with her boyfriend and then sleeps at his house before getting up and going home to get ready for work and getting the kids up for school. My nephew and son have both been smoking weed. Skipping school. Drinking. And I can’t do anything about it because I am just a step parent and have no rights to them. The police say what she is doing isn’t illegal. So I have to just take what time I can with them and let them know I will always be there for them. Even if they didn’t come from me they are still my kids. Now that’s just one part of my life I am dealing with. On to the next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     On December 2nd 2017 my father fell and broke his neck, and wrist coming up the stairs from his basement. On December 5th my father fell again, this time at the hospital, and broke his hip. He was rushed from our small hospital to the main trauma hospital in the state where he underwent a very risky surgery to replace his broken hip. Now my father was is congestive heart failure stage 4 when they operated on him. He had a pacemaker/defibrillator implanted about ten years earlier and his cardiologist told him he would never survive any surgery after that one. Well my father proved him wrong and made it through. He was sent to the local rehabilitation facility after a week in ICU to begin to learn to walk again. It was very hard to see the greatest man I ever knew, in a wheelchair, neck brace and cast on his wrist.  My father was discharged after completing rehabilitation on February 21st. Where he was sent home to get better.  Now I am a twin, and we were born on my fathers birthday. So that was coming up. Ok, on to the next issue of this is my fucked up life.

    In May of 2016 my mothers sister moved back to Iowa. My mother had died back in 2011, so when my aunt showed up it was like getting a piece of my mom back again and it was awesome. Her health wasn’t the greatest when she moved back but she thought she was getting better. On December 22nd of 2017 my aunt was rushed by ambulance to the hospital where she never left. My aunt died on January 3rd. We had grown to be such good friends in the last year and a half it was hard enough, but because she was so like my mother in so many ways, it was like losing my mom and aunt at the same time. I couldn’t handle all the stuff going on in my life at this point. I was more stressed than I had ever been and was just praying for a reprieve. What I didn’t know is life is cruel as fuck. And there is no reprieve when that’s the only thing you want. 

   So, wife and I split October, Dad fell December, Aunt died January. We are all caught up because this next paragraph is gonna suck worse than the last three. March was a slow month however that was life just getting warmed up to fuck my world up worse than I ever could have imagined. Somehow around my birthday(my fathers and sisters as well) I contracted a very communicable virus. My fathers 80th birthday couldn’t have been worse. That was the day neither I, nor my twin, could get to see him, and he found out he had Stage 4 small cell lung cancer. The doctor told him he had less than 6 months and to get his affairs in order. Happy fucking birthday dad, you’re gonna die soon and I can’t even be there to celebrate our last birthday together. My father didnt last 3 months. He died in his house on June 9th. How low can you go you say? Trust me, it can get lower. And it is going to by the time I am done typing this out. The man who taught me how to me a man is dead. My safety net. The one I could always turn to no matter what is now gone. So what do I do? Drugs. For two months I was either drunk or on some sort of benzodiazepine. The middle of August I started coming out of it finally. Not needing a drink to numb myself. Not needing a pill to stop the tears. Here come the shitty paragraph.

I will never forget the date. I will never forget it was sunny out, it wasn’t hot but it wasn’t cool. Two weeks earlier my daughter had told me she was pregnant. And things were starting to look up. But don’t let that fool you, because the other shoe was about to drop, and it was gonna fucking dropkick me in the face and then fuck my life up worse than it already was. August 22nd was the date. I got a phone call from my daughter who was bawling to the point I couldn’t understand her. She finally calmed down enough to tell me to meet her at the ER as she thought she was having a miscarriage. I was devastated. So I hurry up and get dressed with whatever was closest, and make sure the dogs had what they needed and I ran out the door. At the hospital they did all the tests, bloodwork and everything. She didn’t have a miscarriage. But she was told not to do anything stressful that day and to go home and rest. We walked outside of the hospital and she said she was hungry. While discussing where to eat, I received a phone call from my sister telling me my house was on fire and it was on the news. I laughed it off, whatever my house isn’t on fire. That’s when I started getting msgs on Facebook and texts and another phone call while my sister was telling me to get my ass home that it was on fire.  Someone once asked me if there was a time I knew my life had changed and would never be the same. Turning down my street and seeing the smoke, the fire trucks, the cops, the ambulance is when I knew my life was over as I knew it. I ran up to the house to ask about my dogs and the fire chief told me the dogs had gotten out, and I said where are the three German Shepherds? He said no the little black dog and the little white dog got out. I then said, there is three German Shepherd’s in that house. There isn’t many places for them to hide, find my fucking dogs. And I waited. And waited. And waited. I have no idea how long it took before they finally found my  three full grow German Shepherds hiding under my bed but one came running out and as soon as I called his name he came straight to me.  Less than thirty seconds later, the other two came running out almost together. So we load up dogs and head to the vet clinic. Put them in the caged, told them I loved them and I would be back. And went back to my house. Now to find my cats.  The fire department told us we could stay on the south side, but not to go to the north side because they were making sure it wasn’t going to flare up again. We found four cats almost immediately. Took them to the vet clinic. All animals were seen by the vet, dogs had smoke inhalation, one cat had it as well. The vet told me the cat probably wouldn’t make it but he would try his hardest. Still missing one cat, I had so many phone calls to make. My insurance company, Red Cross, utility’s. I smelled like smoke, had no clothes but what on my back. I was able to sleep in a friends apartment. Where I took a shower went to bed to wake up and put the same clothes on. Headed straight to the house, and found the last cat completely unharmed. However, someone had broken in during the night and stole God knows what. So the last cat goes to the vet.  September 1st I was able to get my dogs out of the vet and take them to a temporary home. The next day or the day after the cats went to my sons house to stay until the insurance company decided what to do. My house was broken into no less than three times. And I still don’t know what is missing. The insurance adjuster said my house was salvageable and to find a contractor as soon as possible.  Three days after the fire, the fire inspector told me what started the fire. It was a floor lamp I had bought at Walmart 7 years earlier. No foul play. So I hire a contractor to fix my shit. He said, we will have you in your house by Thanksgiving. I moved back into my house January 24th. Now I was renting to own at this point. So the landlord said I had to get the house in my name immediately. So I figure the house will appraise at way more than what I needed to pay the landlord. So I go to the bank. The house appraised at $65,000 and I needed $38,000. However they wanted 20% down. $7,000. After I had lost everything in the fire. The 29th of January I was served with the right to cure papers. This is after I paid them $17,000 on the price of the house, my insurance company did $55,000 worth of work, and I did countless repairs to make the house better. I’m getting evicted from my house, and no one will rent to me because I have pets. So I call the VA because they help homeless veterans. Their answer to my question was, get rid of your pets. We don’t care about your pets. Honestly that’s what I was told. And we wonder why 22 veterans a day take their own life. So this is my vent. I will be kicked out of my house that I have paid more than $20,000 on and they will get to sell it for $65,000 and make bank because I paid for the insurance and paid the contractor to do work on a house that was taken out from under me as soon as they could. I have quit asking what more could go wrong because I’m afraid life will show me something worse than I have been through. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR divorce, injury, death, more death, Fire, eviction after house is fixed. VA said get rid of your pets before we can help you. &lt;/p&gt;

Also, I gave my dog to my mom two years ago because there was no way for me to keep her at my in-law's place. When my mom passes away, I want to take her, but my husband and I will have to move out in order to do that. He feels that ""the dog isn't worth risking our financial well-being."" It's true that we're not financially prepared to move out yet, but the thought of my dog going to live with a stranger, on top of the death of my mom, feels like too much to handle. I've become so bitter and resentful towards him because of it. All of his annoying habits really seem to piss me off lately.

I want to get away from my life right now. I'm sick of my husband and my nagging in-laws. I wish I could just go off somewhere and disappear.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry but I just really need to unload about some things going on in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been able to convince myself that my ex-boyfriend cheated on me with a girl and is now in a fully committed relationship with her, when he hasn’t even seen her for months. I have also been able to convince myself that I am a worthless human being that will probably never be loved by anyone. While I like to hope that these are both extremely false, I am trying to tell you that the human brain is a powerful weapon. Unfortunately, this weapon is something that people often only use on themselves. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have laid in bed struggling to fall asleep because my stupid inner being wouldn’t shut the fuck up.

Although I probably sound like every other emo teen girl whose parents didn’t buy her a brand new BMW for her 16th birthday, I like to **think** that I have a point here. Whenever I have a problem, I love to turn to my handy dandy “smartphone” to see if this is normal. These problems cover anything from that mysterious bump under my armpit to the fact that I have not cried properly for a solid 5 months and I am incapable of human contact. (I back away when people try to hug me and trust me it is not as quirky and cute as daddy issues are supposed to be!!!!) I guess I just want to know that there is somewhere out there that feels the same way as me, even if it is some random pedophile with a foot fetish hiding behind a computer screen.

Unfortunately despite the millions of searches that google is able to give me, I almost always find myself at the same place I started. Life isn’t something that can be defined by the Oxford Dictionary. (The edgy teen in me felt that now was an okay time to pretend as if I know anything about what life is) Honestly, I know that there is people who go through the same shit as me and a lot, lot worse. I can’t sit here and write this without recognizing that my problems are equivalent to a minnow in an ocean full of sharks. That doesn’t make anyone’s issues less real.

Everyone cries. Everyone also smiles. That does not mean that you have to deal with your problems the same way a person whom (I know I’m fancy) you have never met dealt with theirs. The internet can’t fix your problems, and honestly neither can your mom or your boyfriend or you bestfriend or your 3rd cousin once removed who you think is strangely attractive. Even though you may not think so, you are the only person who can truly deal with the shit in your head. It’s nice to distract yourself once in a while, but at the end of the day when you’re lying in bed those thoughts will be there. So think about it, so maybe you can stop thinking about it.

I’m 25F and I’ve been a pretty big fan of Ariana Grande ever since she started her music career. Hopefully you will hear what I have to say because I truly am hoping for some advice or insight from you all: random strangers that are willing to listen.

First of all, I’ve never watched her on Victorious. I just always heard that she was on Victorious but I never bothered to watch. I was more into Lizzie McGuire and That’s So Raven around that time. (The shows that ended before Victorious started.) I was like 14 or 15 at the time. And when both shows closed out their series, I didn’t really look for a new kid show to watch. Usually whatever my brother (2 yrs younger) put on I would watch. (Like Spongebob.) I believe that is also around the time when YouTube started out.

Anywho, when AG came out with her first album, I was curious and gave it a listen. I only knew she could sing because I saw her videos on YouTube! And if you don’t know, she was recording YouTube videos alongside working on Victorious. So instead of Victorious, I was watching her on YouTube. And I was just in awe of her amazing amazing voice. Someone as rare to compare to Mariah Carey, a musical legend. And ever since her first album, I’ve just always listened to her! I’ll have her on repeat for the entire day, maybe even days straight. I usually never get tired of listening to her. And if I take a break from listening to AG, I’ll be listening to Hip Hop and R&amp;B, sometimes pop.

So every album she’s came out with, including this year’s, I’ve loved. And in 2017 (23yrs) I went to her concert. A friend came with me for moral support bc no one else would go with me, but she wasn’t much of an AG fan. (She says she is but I can tell she’s not.) And a good majority, like 93% of the crowd were all under 18. They were all in elementary school, middle school, and high school. I barely saw anyone that looked like a college student. I am admitting the fact that I felt so embarrassed bc everyone was so much younger. At the same time, I did enjoy myself because I knew every song and was singing along. However, I’d remind myself every now and then to tone it down bc my friend next to me only knew the mainstream songs.

I’m going to Coachella in April and I bought my ticket way before the lineup came out. Didn’t even believe she’d ever play at Coachella. And when I saw her on the lineup? Omg. My heart freaked out. I wanted to scream for joy. And I was in a public setting so I had to retain my high excitement. And...idk I just feel like no one my age likes her the way I do, or sees her the way I do. I don’t see her as someone who acts like a little girl (the perception people seem to reveal). I see her as the same age as me (because we are the same age) and as this talented af artist that’s the same freakin age as me!!!! We’re the same age and she’s talented and beautiful affff; that is just so cool to me. It’s like hey, we pretty much grew up together without even knowing each other.

But anywho...idk I’m starting to feel really self conscious about being a big fan of her 😕 to the point where I wanna try to convince myself to be a fan of someone else: someone portrayed as older, someone who doesn’t have underage kids as the majority of their fan base. (Which doesn’t make sense bc Cardi B is the same age.)  Or even try to pretend that I don’t have a favorite artist 😕 idk, what do you guys think? This post may sound silly to you but I am honestly serious. It is something I am truly self conscious about and would genuinely like advice for.

There was no money left over for the joint account (not sure how since I was paying his truck payment). So my job paid for ... actually everything. 

Well he got a new job. And now he has to take lunches to work. And needed new clothes. So what do I do? I spent my one day off work trying to get him to pick out foods he would eat, went to 3 stores to pick out clothes the whole deal. And today I got up an extra hour early to make sure he had a full lunch. I was nearly late and didn’t have time for my own breakfast or lunch. 

He only worked 7-1pm. Came home. House is a MESS. And he’s gone. His plans for the afternoon - clean his truck and go to the gym. And on top of all of that - he ate enough food from his lunch that could have sustained a small army. I’m taking oatmeal &amp; fruit, 5 scrambled eggs with cheese, massive sandwich and salad. Cheese and crackers, mixed nuts.. (I know it’s not the healthiest but I’m trying to find foods he won’t complain about. Give me a break) and he left ALL his dishes just in the sink. Not even an attempt to clean up. 

I just worked a 11 hour day. (+ 45 min to get ready for work &amp; 1.5 hours for morning chores) And now I have to make dinner. Clean the house. Wash his clothes. Make his lunch. Before I can even begin to think about sleep. I have 10.75 hours before I work again. 

I work 6-7 days a week, 10-14 hour days. I’m an introvert down deep and my job requires me to manage people. So I don’t have a lot of friends because I just don’t have time/energy for that after work. I want to go to the gym because that makes me happy but I’m just physically spent after all that. 

I have no idea where to vent. Or how to not be upset at my husband. I’m exhausted. Any suggestions? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so my husband had a job that barely paid for his lifestyle. There was no money left over for the joint account (not sure how since I was paying his truck payment). So my job paid for ... actually everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well he got a new job. And now he has to take lunches to work. And needed new clothes. So what do I do? I spent my one day off work trying to get him to pick out foods he would eat, went to 3 stores to pick out clothes the whole deal. And today I got up an extra hour early to make sure he had a full lunch. I was nearly late and didn’t have time for my own breakfast or lunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He only worked 7-1pm. Came home. House is a MESS. And he’s gone. His plans for the afternoon - clean his truck and go to the gym. And on top of all of that - he ate enough food from his lunch that could have sustained a small army. I’m taking oatmeal &amp;amp; fruit, 5 scrambled eggs with cheese, massive sandwich and salad. Cheese and crackers, mixed nuts.. (I know it’s not the healthiest but I’m trying to find foods he won’t complain about. Give me a break) and he left ALL his dishes just in the sink. Not even an attempt to clean up. &lt;/p&gt;

I am currently 14 years old. When I was about two my parents divorced because of constant fighting and in the same year I found out that I was asthmatic and badly so. Unfortunately, I still remember some of these fights but that's not necessary what fucked me. I was lucky enough to have my a fair judge who made my parents split me throughout the week. Also, I'm pretty sure I had social-emotional problems even before all this shit happened. 

And as all divorced parents tend to do they both told me lies about each other, but my mom was by far the worse of the two.  She pulled me out of my dad's car a few times when it was his day with me, she told me constant lies such as my dad was a filthy monster because he ended up getting remarried and she didn't(and still isn't), also she ended up taking me to a physiologist to tell lies about my dad, and at first I did. I told lies such as my dad got pulled over by cops once a week, and that he cheated on my stepmom. At times I refused to do this and my mom would say something that I rather not repeat here, this also took place right in front of the physoclist. (Take in mind that I was 3-4 when all these things happened.)

Now on to my dad. When I was 4 my dad and stepmom had a kid. It was a girl and this is where things really went downhill. They would raise their voices at me for little things like putting my sister down on the couch so I could play with her. This made me retreat to my room where I still spend my days. Also when I did try to get out of my room when I was about 7, my dad and stepmom just asked me what I wanted and sent me back to my room because that was the norm at that point.

On to school. For kindergarten, I went to a VERY shitty school called Elmcrest Elementary in Reno, Nevada. Feel free to look it up it's truly a piece of shit. This place did have some benefits. Here was the first time I felt I could be myself and I made some friends because of it. At the end of kindergarten, the school quite literally told me and most of my class, ""You're too smart for us, here are some other schools you should go to."" This meant that the few friends that I made where leaving, fortunately, one of them ended up going to the same school as I. 

In the second grade, I broke my arm in two places and dislocated it. I apparently broke it so bad that I had to go into surgery that lasted for four hours. This brought what I believe was around $3,000 worth of medical bill(These numbers are probably wrong). This ended up causing a lot of stress for me because my mom refused to pay for her part of the bill and a lot of tension came up between my parents that was directed at me.

The rest of first through fifth grade went fine but I started to feel constant pressure on me because my parents took me getting A's and B's as me being a genius. My teachers didn't help this by constantly praising me in front of my parents and other students. This lead to even more pressure because everyone in my class thought I was the smartest kid ever. This all ended in 6th grade when I got severely depressed and I got something like psychosis. For those of you who don't know what psychosis is, it is when you have formication, can't sleep, your speech becomes unclear, and your behavior becomes disorganized. This ended with my grades dropping a bit and my parents putting more pressure on me, which caused more depression and then an endless cycle nearly began. The cycle ended with me nearly taking my life. This luckily failed. I still haven't talked to my parents about this, and they don't know that I tried to take my life.

I have less energy to do things, my mind is cramped with negativity and death, and i don’t care about anything expect my lonely pathetic soul. 

Who is doing this to me and other mentally ill people and why? I don’t want to suffer anymore. Why give me hope of getting better and getting my life back, just to take them away in the next minute? 

You know what’s most pathetic about this? Everything is in your head and it’s so fxxking real. That’s your reality. From other people perspective you are just being tired or your usual self, but inside you are being burned alive. Nobody knows. You have to keep it to yourself, or they will soon get bored of your frequent whining. They have their lives to worry about.

I want to get better. I want to be normal again. I want to finish college like i was going to do like i was meant to do before this illness sets on. I want to enjoy life. Damn i want to enjoy life.  I can’t do it. I was trying so hard.  

In the end of the day i am still whining under the influence of my illnesses. 

I am taking medication, doing CBT, taking extra nutrients.  If any of you who read this want to know.

I’m, also, about to get put back on birth control, so you know what that means.

I hope she gives you scabies again, or maybe even chlamydia, or gonorrhea, so you have to go to the hospital, &amp; realize that with an autoimmune disease, it was fucking stupid to risk your life, just to indulge in your obsession with her. 
Last, don’t you EVER assume that you have ANY right to judge me, or my choices. You lost that right years ago.

I’m not justifying my younger self saying or acting any sort of way but I believe that the way I acted in was due to how I was also treated at that age. I thought that by apologizing I would also be able to start my own healing process. Instead, it has opened up a huge wound for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This truly is a vent and I’m not even sure that anyone can help but I needed somewhere to let this out.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, I am a twin, so I had to deal with the feeling of guilt that came with being the only one to get accepted into our dream college that we both applied to. This was made even worse, because due to my eye surgeries, I missed the initial college orientation I signed up for, and had to sign up for a different last minute one, and since my prescription was still significantly altered and I needed to do eyedrops like 5 times a day in both eyes at this point, my sister ended up helping me out during the whole 3-day orientation for her dream school that she didn't even get accepted into.

Furthermore, I also got my wisdom teeth out the week before my eye surgery craziness, so I got sedated 3 times within the span of a month. In addition, my sister got her wisdom teeth out the same day as one of my eye surgeries.

And the final cherry on top was that my town was still recovering from a massive fire that took place roughly a year before the fated summer.

I'm sick of not having real friends. My closest friend lives 3000 miles away, and we've seen each other once in the last six years. 

I'm married, and while I know I am supposed to consider my wife my closest friend, I'm not so sure.

We've had a rocky relationship from the beginning. I didn't really know how to be in a relationship before I met her. Also, I was an asshole. Not in the sense that I was abusive or anything, but I would constantly fuck around with other women online. 

I've recently discovered, through introspection, that this attention-seeking behavior, is probably in response to the lack of power I have felt my entire life around women. In fact, I don't think I've ever had a relationship that didn't start, to some degree, by electronic means. Is that a sign of the times, or just my own flaw? Who knows? Anyway, I think the anonymity allows me to say things I would be too nervous to say in person, and women would go for it. It's manipulative and deceitful and wrong.

So as for the not being happy thing, I've done that to myself. Well, not entirely. When I first moved in with my now wife, she basically told me that if I was serious about her I'd drop everything and move to her place. So I did. I quit my job, left my apartment I loved, and left my friends to be with her. While I was at her place, she was working to feed us both and her daughter. I grew stagnant in my job search, but the verbal abuse grew way before then. I had never felt so low. It got to the point where I had the upstairs neighbors come down one time while she was at work to tell me that I shouldn't put up with her berating me like that...

I didn't listen. I stayed with her, and continued to electronically cheat on her. I remember being scolded for crying many times. I think in a lot of ways, her behavior changed me for the better. I'm no longer such an emotional man. I grew a thick skin. My mother was manipulative in her emotions and threw guilt trips quite often. Tears were shed almost every day, and I learned that that was just normal behavior. 

Not anymore. I can't remember the last time I cried.

My wife stopped drinking, and the verbal abuse stopped (mostly) with it. 

I have two children with her now. I'm in it for the long haul. She does a lot of things I don't agree with, but I feel like nothing I say will matter. So I keep my mouth shut. Mostly these things are how she chooses to spend her time and how she raises the kids... I won't go into detail. 

I haven't been a good husband. At least that's how I see it with regard to my cheating. But she reassures me that I'm a great one. Except when we get into an argument and she brings up my indiscretions.

I don't know if anything will ever change, and I could keep venting for hours and not run out of new things to say. I don't want sympathy. I just need to get this out to SOMEONE.

I came to the conclusion and realization I am emotionally dissociative. I can’t shut it off. I’m also a Demi sexual. Basically what this means is 1, I don’t feel emotions like other people. I don’t fall in love or WANT people a specific way. Car crashes, murders, death, etc etc do not effect me the same way it does another. I know socially these are all sad things, but I know that we all come to an end and unfortunately these are how these people die. I think about death quiet a bit and morals and ethics. 
Demisexual means I don’t have a physical relationship with someone until I feel an emotional connection. Aka- ONE NIGHT STANDS AND CASUAL SEX is a no go for me. Some demisexuals can, I can’t. 

I always feel weird because of these things and topics when brought up because my nonchalant about it. I don’t care about sex or nudity. But to an average person it may seem I’m “missing a screw” and it pisses me off I can’t be that normal person to find someone attractive and have casual sexual relation and actually care about someone dying. 

But I’m not. I’m not a sociopath, because I don’t try to manipulate people into my gain since I know this to be wrong, I would feel bad, and I’m not materialistic. I could envy, but I wouldn’t stop a friendship for something so petty or small as envy or greed. But at the same time I could easily kill a man if push comes to shove. Taking full responsibility for ending his life and potential of their future and the burden of the mourning of his love ones, but not regret it it they were coming at me with attempt to harm me.

I never knew how true this statement was till recently. I Put myself never ending torment and bliss. I have brainwashed myself time and time again with all good things that has ever happen. I worshiped the very space of a man where he once stood. I have A love that's put me in a eternal servitude or slavery to one man. He's kind and sweet. As well as loving and romantic. Force myself to remember every single detail of his body and moments we spent.

The silence, it’s agonizing and terrifying. The distance makes you feel loneliness which is best explain by being in room with no one around. A suffocating sadness that makes you wish you could turn everything you feel off. I will never leave, I will never go. My loyalty is unbreakable. Someday I hope that things will change he will never leave my side. I won't pretend that this will happen like sweet dream to help you sleep. More praying that things will work out in the end. I am not psyche, I can not see the future. So wait and find as much comfort as possible to make it to the end. It's because of his love of his work he's gone, as well as The passion he feels for it.

(I havent been diagnosed with a sex addiction but it's gotten to the point where it controls a large part of my life and I have little control over it, I have though been diagnosed with very bad expresso depresso and some eating disorders) and my girlfriend and I were organising a threeway With this girl me know who has a massive crush on both of us, apparently more so me. So after us all talking about having a threeway and things getting a little sexual between the three of us my girlfriend was really busy for the following three days and therefore couldn't text me so I messaged the girl instead. I was messaging her And she was sending me videos of her talking then she sent me a photo of her wearing only a bra, she sent a similar photo to my girlfriend and I the night before. I told her that she couldn't do that and that it was really wrong and she panicked, and was really sorry Then assured me it wouldn't happen again and asked me Not to tell my girlfriend (they're really close friends and she didn't wanna ruin that). A day or two later were messaging about threeway and things we hoped wojld happen and she said she had to go shower so I said goodbye, then she messaged me something about missing her show, then sent me a photo of her biting her finger - context; I have a massive thing for people biting their lips and fingers - i was put back by it although I didn't really think it was horrible at the time because it was just her face in the photo and her finger, then she kepted sending them until the last one was her in the shower biting her finger, the photo showed her in the shower biting her finger, it was clear that she had no clothes on but you couldn't see anything, it was from her shoulders up. I then stepped of of my stupid horny state and told her that that was bad, that we shouldn't of done it, and that it can never happen again. Right now I feel like she manipulated me a little to get a reaction, she was really into doing that, and I feel really fucking sad that I was vulnerable enough to let it happen. I told my girlfriend today then she walked away and cried. She said she didn't want to see me for the rest of the day. I told her that I was sorry and explained the situation. I really love her, more than anything and I'm afraid I've fucked it all up, I told her I don't love her but don't think she should be with me, she's hasn't responded to any of my messages.

So after us all talking about having a threeway and things getting a little sexual between the three of us my girlfriend was really busy for the following three days and therefore couldn&amp;#39;t text me so I messaged the girl instead. I was messaging her And she was sending me videos of her talking then she sent me a photo of her wearing only a bra, she sent a similar photo to my girlfriend and I the night before. I told her that she couldn&amp;#39;t do that and that it was really wrong and she panicked, and was really sorry Then assured me it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen again and asked me Not to tell my girlfriend (they&amp;#39;re really close friends and she didn&amp;#39;t wanna ruin that). A day or two later were messaging about threeway and things we hoped wojld happen and she said she had to go shower so I said goodbye, then she messaged me something about missing her show, then sent me a photo of her biting her finger - context; I have a massive thing for people biting their lips and fingers - i was put back by it although I didn&amp;#39;t really think it was horrible at the time because it was just her face in the photo and her finger, then she kepted sending them until the last one was her in the shower biting her finger, the photo showed her in the shower biting her finger, it was clear that she had no clothes on but you couldn&amp;#39;t see anything, it was from her shoulders up. I then stepped of of my stupid horny state and told her that that was bad, that we shouldn&amp;#39;t of done it, and that it can never happen again. Right now I feel like she manipulated me a little to get a reaction, she was really into doing that, and I feel really fucking sad that I was vulnerable enough to let it happen. I told my girlfriend today then she walked away and cried. She said she didn&amp;#39;t want to see me for the rest of the day. I told her that I was sorry and explained the situation. I really love her, more than anything and I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ve fucked it all up, I told her I don&amp;#39;t love her but don&amp;#39;t think she should be with me, she&amp;#39;s hasn&amp;#39;t responded to any of my messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck I want to die&lt;/p&gt;

A warning, this is a story of mild sexual abuse and physical abuse. However I like to keep these things tactful.


For some context. I am female. My mother and I got out of a toxic and very controlling environment with my father. To sum it up shortly, we weren't allowed to go anywhere for more than a few (2-3) hours and any thing I did to upset my father was lashed out against my mother. This does include physical violence. That is past (4 years ago), we were able to get away from it thanks to my then boyfriend, henceforth referred to simply as Ex. Ex wasn't a bad guy, yes he was very sexual, but at the time I didn't think anything would come from that.


Now Ex had a much higher paying job at the time than my Mother or I, so we need him to room with us to split the bills. That's the problem though, he knew we couldn't be here without him. 


Our relationship began to dwindle when we moved in, as he began to become more sexually demanding. To the point I would be in pain afterwards from the frequency of encounters and the rough treatment of those encounters. Even when I spoke to him, saying him blatantly I was sore, he wanted it anyway. I started to feel like nothing but a toy to him, as he continued to seek out encounters with me despite my protests and telling him my feelings. I wasn't able to sleep most nights without giving in, just to have some solace from his advances. If I was lucky, I would be left in peace for a few days. Before when he was a little too aggressive, I stayed home and away from him. Now that he was in the some home as me, there was no escape from it. There was one time he did try to touch me in my sleep. This is important to note, as I explicitly told him never to do this again.


Fast forward awhile, and I tired of feeling degraded and used. I tell him so. My words to him were clear; I felt used and that all he wanted was sex from me. He said he would show me otherwise. Admittedly, he was trying to connect to me on other levels than just sexual. He was failing miserably. Mostly because the ulterior motive was to blatant to be ignored, in spite of what he said. Ex also had to be the smartest person in the room and anything that I said that made me seem more intelligent that what he was comfortable with ""wasn't exsactly"" what he had meant or a ""common misconception"". 


He spoke at length to me multiple times during our relationship about moving down to his childhood home in another state. I always refused because I was afraid to leave my Mother with my Father, and I had absolutely no family in that state. We went to that neighborhood on a ""day trip"" while trying to patch things up. He was trying to convince me to do things his way, to move away from everyone I knew. That was a big red flag to me, and I explained I didn't think this was him just showing me his childhood home for fun. He got very defensive, I became more distant. He knew my Mother was encouraging me to stand my ground.


Then he took me to an outdoor nature center, something I loved. Until he ruined the night by again approaching me for an encounter. By this point, I believe it had been 3 months since the last time, but showing him I could be paid off with a fancy trip was not something I wanted, and so refused. I told him this.


Ex took me into a few states away to have a week away with him. On the first night there, he approached me. This time, I was sick from a restaurant we visited earlier. Told him as such, and he slept with his back towards me. I banished myself to the couch in the room for the reminder of the trip. The trip home was quiet.


Now comes the reason I now sleep in the closet. A few months after the last trip, I feel him try to touch me again. Ex knew that I didn't want it. I had been refusing him for months and told him nothing he was doing was reassuring me, to stop throwing money at the problem because I wouldn't be bought. Refusing to believe he was actually doing this, I moved away rather aggressively and in my half asleep state growled out something resembling a ""no"". I doze off again, thinking he had gotten the hint.


I awoke again, this time with a familiar moisture, and the feeling of a finger to the hilt within me.


The resulting argument and absolute hell storm of outraged verbal hatred woke my mother and her boyfriend (go mom for being able to move on!). I was firm and blatant with him with the issues I had, and molesting me in my sleep was the final straw. I told him I could not trust him, would not trust him, and would be moving into the large walk-in closet a door away from him. I left 2 hours early for work that day. That night, I stayed with a friend from my work.


2 years later, I am still living in the walk in closet. I have gotten rid of half of my belongings to fit in here. In the first few months, Ex still tried to solicit me, or tell me I was the best he ever had. Compliments on my body, or expressing he wanted to go back with me was met with the same response. No. More recently, he's been trying to get on friendly terms. Most hilarious of which, is saying he respected me. Yes, respected me as a person *nearly* as intelligent as him. I think you all can see the immediate backfire of such a statement.


In good news, he should be going into the military next year. Though he said this the year before as well, I try to remain hopeful. I have to be. For any of you that actually read all of this, I'm sure it was quite lengthy, and I thank you. No doubt I don't sound very upset about all of this. I've told the story many times. Including to my very caring boss that recently retired. I hope that perhaps writing it down and sending it off, I can finally let it rest and move on. Doing this already makes me feel a little lighter.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with for a while, and I&amp;#39;m just tired.

Ex also had to be the smartest person in the room and anything that I said that made me seem more intelligent that what he was comfortable with &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t exsactly&amp;quot; what he had meant or a &amp;quot;common misconception&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He spoke at length to me multiple times during our relationship about moving down to his childhood home in another state. I always refused because I was afraid to leave my Mother with my Father, and I had absolutely no family in that state. We went to that neighborhood on a &amp;quot;day trip&amp;quot; while trying to patch things up. He was trying to convince me to do things his way, to move away from everyone I knew. That was a big red flag to me, and I explained I didn&amp;#39;t think this was him just showing me his childhood home for fun. He got very defensive, I became more distant. He knew my Mother was encouraging me to stand my ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he took me to an outdoor nature center, something I loved. Until he ruined the night by again approaching me for an encounter. By this point, I believe it had been 3 months since the last time, but showing him I could be paid off with a fancy trip was not something I wanted, and so refused. I told him this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex took me into a few states away to have a week away with him. On the first night there, he approached me. This time, I was sick from a restaurant we visited earlier. Told him as such, and he slept with his back towards me. I banished myself to the couch in the room for the reminder of the trip. The trip home was quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the reason I now sleep in the closet. A few months after the last trip, I feel him try to touch me again. Ex knew that I didn&amp;#39;t want it. I had been refusing him for months and told him nothing he was doing was reassuring me, to stop throwing money at the problem because I wouldn&amp;#39;t be bought. Refusing to believe he was actually doing this, I moved away rather aggressively and in my half asleep state growled out something resembling a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. I doze off again, thinking he had gotten the hint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke again, this time with a familiar moisture, and the feeling of a finger to the hilt within me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting argument and absolute hell storm of outraged verbal hatred woke my mother and her boyfriend (go mom for being able to move on!). I was firm and blatant with him with the issues I had, and molesting me in my sleep was the final straw. I told him I could not trust him, would not trust him, and would be moving into the large walk-in closet a door away from him. I left 2 hours early for work that day. That night, I stayed with a friend from my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 years later, I am still living in the walk in closet. I have gotten rid of half of my belongings to fit in here. In the first few months, Ex still tried to solicit me, or tell me I was the best he ever had. Compliments on my body, or expressing he wanted to go back with me was met with the same response. No. More recently, he&amp;#39;s been trying to get on friendly terms. Most hilarious of which, is saying he respected me. Yes, respected me as a person &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; as intelligent as him. I think you all can see the immediate backfire of such a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In good news, he should be going into the military next year. Though he said this the year before as well, I try to remain hopeful. I have to be. For any of you that actually read all of this, I&amp;#39;m sure it was quite lengthy, and I thank you. No doubt I don&amp;#39;t sound very upset about all of this. I&amp;#39;ve told the story many times. Including to my very caring boss that recently retired. I hope that perhaps writing it down and sending it off, I can finally let it rest and move on. Doing this already makes me feel a little lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't remember why but at the end of the day I started feeling down, My dad even noticed that I was being quiet, more so than usual. It didn't seem like that big of a deal to me at the time, but I would assume that had something to do with my major break down today.

Another thing to mention is that I have anxiety and haphephobia (a fear of being touched) and both of those play into me having a large personal space, and it makes me uncomfortable when people enter it, more so adults. So today in class, what seemed like an average day for probably 20 minutes after I arrived, I already was feeling more anxious than usual. Usually my anxiety isn't super bad, unless it's triggered by something, which it was.

This was a class I have taken before and failed, so I knew the material and stuff (hence why I had headphones in). While the teacher was reading a passage of something, the other teacher (there's two?) came up very close to me (trigger 1) and told me to take out my headphones (Trigger). Now, it doesn't seem like much, but music helps me calm down a lot, and I hate being told off, even calmly. Not because I have a problem with following the rules, but it always feels like I'm flooded with memories and emotions I don't know about.

So immediately my anxiety is heightened and I can feel my eyes get teary. I usually get confused with myself as to why I'm tearing up, and I feel like an idiot, which makes me want to cry more. So I take one of my earbuds out and try to calm down. Again, (understandably, I'm not blaming the teacher) she comes over and asks me to take both of them out, more sternly. She was also closer to me. This causes me to get slightly angry and throw my earbuds down, now shaking more than before, and trying to hide my face in my sleeves.

At this point I start shaking and crying, hiding my face because i'm humiliated about being so dramatic. Eventually, I get up and leave, something I have never done before. I go into the bathroom to try and calm down, but it just gets worse. I have difficulty breathing and regaining thoughts, I almost feel like i'm drowning. Mid-panic attack, I decide that I need to go home *right now.* I get my mom to come pick me up, and go home. Though my anxiety is still high through the day, I eventually begin to ignore it, even though my body is still shaky and hurts.

I had a friend to talk to once I got home. I hate venting to my friends because I always feel annoying (I stopped venting so much recently, I realized what a nuisance I was being), so I didn't tell him.

So of course it’s coming up on Valentine’s Day. Where I work we make chocolate covered strawberries. A lady yesterday placed an order for 4 dozen. So I made 4 dozen. I spent easily an hour prepping these. Counting only a million times. Making 4 trays of 12. I picked the most delicious looking strawberries too.

This lady would not be coming in until later. Way past my shift. The next person to take over the shift I told them in which areas each order was placed in the fridge. I made about 17 dozen strawberries throughout the day while working by myself. There were only two orders left. Very simple. I explained two bags were for customer A and 2 bags were for customer B. Customer A got theirs all good.

Later by the time the store closes,  my co-worker calls me all flustered in tears saying that customer B says she only received 24 strawberries. This doesn’t make sense to me. As a manager I’m used to customers (especially with the strawberries) trying to pull a fast one on me. Last year a horrible lady claimed to have not received 4 dozen of her 6 dozen order. At that time I wasn’t manager, but the manager made me pay for it out of my pocket...$70 gone like that. And that lady walked away with that...

So you can understand I have trust issues. So I call this lady and ask her about these missing strawberries. I explained that it is highly unlikely because there is a huge difference between 24 and 48 strawberries. There’s no possible way I could have missed 2 whole perfectly dozen strawberries. And it’s not like My co-worker could mess up the order because the orders between customer A and B were for the same amount. So in the end it didn’t matter who’s order went to who, we just had it organized for the time for pick up.

So I explained that sometimes there are smaller strawberries and they’re hidden under the bigger ones. She says she can see them perfectly fine. She asks me how I can fit 4 dozen strawberries into 6 containers if a container can hold up to 6 strawberries max depending on size. Again...who’s to say she’s not just lying to me? Anyone can just pretend. I mean I’ve messed up orders in the past by leaving off one or two strawberries before...but an entire 2 dozen?!? 

I ask her to remove them from the containers and count. She only counts 8 and then counts 5 and she’s like “see I don’t see how you think this is the right amount?!? Are you calling me a liar? Why would I lie?” I explain to her I’m not calling her a liar. I once again reiterate that I just don’t see how her order is missing exactly 24 strawberries. She continues saying something but at this point I’m just rubbing my head thinking of what to do. At this point she was spewing a bunch a numbers like 24 and 32...I should have 70 (to which I pointed out 4 dozen would be 60). So I just said “ok, how much do I owe you?” And she says “it doesn’t really matter now, but I’m about 2 dozen short” and once again asks why I think she would lie. (Me thinking yet again, customers lie all the time to get free stuff). So I just told her “I guess I’ll make up 24 new strawberries for you tomorrow and you can pick them up tomorrow anytime you want.” At this point I’m really annoyed. 1) I know I counted damn 48 strawberries 2) I counted 100 million times it was 48 and 3) I have to give away 2 dozen free strawberries and while I’m the manager, my boss is going to be asking me questions..and probably make me pay again. 

She agrees and I tell her to have a wonderful night. Honestly as she escalated I did too. Especially after she said I was accusing her of lying, but she added that my co-worker must have given them to someone else or took them. How are you about to accuse someone, but you feel horrible because I “accused” you of lying? 

Turns out my co-worker didn’t give her 2 bags. She didn’t pay attention to my instructions. How she thought 4 dozen strawberries were going to fit into 1 bag idk. I had her call the customer and apologize to which the lady told her I was rude and she didn’t like my tone. She also apparently mocked my voice and made me sound how I did not, or ever would. So now I feel stupid for being slightly bitchy over nothing. But at the same time angry because it turned out to be an honest mistake. Now tomorrow I’m going to add an extra dozen for the trouble and pay for that. I’m sure this isn’t going to be the last time I hear from her...I’m pretty sure something is going to be written in to my boss or a review left. Ugh 😑 


I feel bad that customers are so bad, that I can’t trust the ones that tell the truth. This is how things get ruined for people.

A few months ago, I was waiting to cross this intersection on campus. Finally a car stopped and the driver signaled me to cross.

I don't like walking across the road when another car is there, but this car was stopped and so I decided to cross. Right when I put my foot in the road, the car sped up, almost hitting me.

Just around half an hour ago, I was coming back home after a meeting on campus. There is a small road with a crosswalk. Cars are supposed to stop to let pedestrians cross so I feel comfortable crossing. I was crossing, looked both ways and a car was coming. I thought it was going to slow down so I decided to cross. The car didn't and I had to literally jump out of the way. I didn't get a good look at the driver, but it looked like she(?) was texting.

That is when I discovered she had told Joe what happened soon after the party, but for unknown reasons he waited 3 months to tell me. By this point, she had blocked my number, which is understandable. He also ""forgot"" to pass on my apology.

It took some doing, but I was finally able to figure out a way to apologize to her directly. She did accept my apology. This isn't about whether I did something wrong, I take total responsibility for that. He actually had the nerve to call me a ""fucktard"" for showing her my messages with him where I felt like a total dick and asked him to please let her know I'm sorry, and is mad at me because she 'unfriended' him over it.

Everybody at my school seems to be in perfect shape and have the perfect body, everywhere I look there’s pretty faces,hourglass figures and flat stomachs. That’s my problem,I have a round stomach, broad shoulders, an ugly face and fat all around my body.

Even then if I glance at another girls stomach i have to ask to go to the bathroom so I can cry. I can barely enjoy anything anymore because of this, if there’s one mention of exercise, fitness or weight it reminds me of my body.Sometimes it’s not even because of this, sometimes it’s because of that o glance at a models stomach or my sister comes to show me her new crop top.

It’s more bearable in the winter because everyone else is covering up but where I am it’s almost time for bikini season. Which is the worst time ever. I see everyone in their bikinis which everyone is expected to wear,nobody wears one pieces. And when I try to wear bikinis my stomach hangs out,the straps emphasize my shoulders and my thighs show.

I’m doing my best to lose weight and be healthier. I just started a new sport, I’m not eating sweets and the days when I don’t have my sport I workout, I’m too embarrassed to ask my family for me to go on a diet, and my family is not exactly healthy.But my sister has a the same or even a worse diet then me and does the same amount of exercise and has abs.I end up crying at least once a day about it.

I am so, SO stressed out. I know I have to do wedding stuff, but the last thing I want to do is think about planning anything. Making major decisions regarding our wedding is making me nauseous and anxious. I'm so afraid that I'm going to end up offending someone or this person won't like this one, etc.
Everyone has been giving us their opinions since day one and the decisions I HAVE made are probably going to get some kind of backlash. I thought wedding planning was supposed to be fun but I have zero interest in doing anything anymore.

Let me make it very clear that I love my fiance, we've known each other for 9 years and dated for around 8 and a half.  Being with him for the rest of my life doesn't freak me out. We've already picked our date (september 2019) and venue, did a tasting, made our save the dates, created our guest list. That was all fine because it was just me and him making decisions. It's when I include others or listen to people's opinions that I get super stressed out. I kind of wish we could just elope, honestly.

I know it's about Us, not anyone else, and the best thing to do is not to listen to anyone and do what makes us happy, but it's hard when all I hear is YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS BY NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR ABC XYZ OMG PICK YOUR DRESS. 

I feel like a total freak for not wanting to do anything wedding related and I wish people would leave me alone. Am I the only one to feel like this?

We just got a pretty decent cold front. Not like north of us or east but for Texas it was cold. My family likes to keep the heater on 75. It is way too hot. So I had my husband turn it up/down whichever it is to make it come on less often. Well, I ended up getting too cold, my sinuses had a field day and now I’m blowin blood out of my nose with a fricken sore throat. Not to mention my arthritis has flared up with the cold temps that I’m in so much pain. 

I just want to lay in bed and sleep it off. But I have classes during the week and I have homework. This blows! LOL

I’m in IT so my homework is plentiful and hard. I can’t concentrate long enough to care. Luckily, there is no late penalties if I turn them in later. I just don’t feel good. I’m 35 and having arthritis in my lower back and knees along with carpal tunnel is just not cool. And I LOVE the cold my body just doesn’t. 

I’m trying to eat better as I am obese which is so not helping the subject. I am allergic to many foods that are common staples. Corn, Wheat, Gluten, Orange, Soy, Peanut, Coffee, Yeast, Tomato, and Potato. So only potatoes, corn, and peanuts are really bothersome. The rest are more like intolerances. But if I eat them it causes me to gain weight because my body can’t digest it properly. And I’ve been reading that if I do eat them it flares up or creates the arthritis symptoms. So I’m trying to wean off them cuz like you don’t want to go cold turkey. It feels like coming off heroine. Done that before, food not heroine. I was told from a friend that what I was feeling was similar to what he was feeling coming off heroine. So that’s fun. 

It just costs a lot. I try to eat a lot of rice. Both brown and white as it doesn’t matter if I eat white right now. I’m just having issues cooking because I hurt so bad. I can barely stand. Getting to classes is a hassle. I park in handicap which makes me feel bad, but there’s absolutely no way I could park in common parking area. 

Today, I have to do laundry for the week, cook me up some rice for the week. I use stock not plain water that’s just disgusting (plain water rice). I made some a couple weeks ago and it was a big/huge batch of rice lasted all week. But I put way too much Parmesan cheese in it. It was almost sickeningly cheesy and I LOVE cheese. So going to use much less Parmesan this time. 

My husband gets paid this coming Friday and he’s been working 3 weeks of work in 2 weeks so he’s got lots of OT coming. I get a bit more for my grocery budget. That’s helpful. I’m going to get me some generic velveeta. I know it’s not good, but it’s cool. And make me some cheesy buffalo chicken pasta (rice pasta). I can’t wait. 

Last time I was on this way of eating (12 years ago) I had lost a significant amount of weight without exercise. I’m hoping to recreate it and then some. I’m also hoping it causes the inflammation and arthritis pain to subside or go away. I know I need to reduce my cheese intake as it can cause inflammation, but I just love cheese. 

I’ll figure it out. I just needed to talk. I can’t talk to anyone in my house about it. No one cares. My husband doesn’t understand it and quite frankly doesn’t care to understand it. He’s a southern boy who eats meat, potatoes, and toast. So he doesn’t understand not being able to eat potatoes or the rest. He loves eating out fast food. And he wants me to join in, and I end up doing it cuz like tacos or burgers are fricken awesome. But the bun or shell aren’t on my list of good foods so then I’m stuck back at square one. And forget pizza. Like pizza, cheeseburgers, and tacos are my favorite foods. Can’t have corn shell, flour tortilla, bun, tomato, crust, tomato sauce. So I try to just eat at home and I’m stuck with rice. It’s just not fair. My sisters doing the Keto with almost zero carbs and I thought about it, but jeez that’s a lot of eggs. I’m not an eggy person. I like scrambled and fried eggs, but that egg bread is horrible. It’s WAY too eggy. Those little egg muffins are great fresh but when you make up a big batch and fridge them it turns horrible and so fake tasting. I don’t know how she’s doing it. She’s lost 12# so far. 

I have very low will power obviously. I’m trying hard to work on that. It just takes a lot of cooking on my part and when you can’t stand very long cuz of immense pain it sucks. My mom will help but she always contaminates it somehow. She knows, but has this CRS disease when she’s cooking and spaces it off and there goes tomatoes or potatoes in my food. She has a walker, cuz she was falling a lot that you can sit on and it withstands 350# which is about 15# less than I am but my fat ass can hardly fit in the width span of it to sit and roll around. Might have to just do it and be careful not to break it today just so I can make me some rice and sweet snacks like chocolate chip cookie bar.

If you’ve read it thanks. I just needed somewhere to write out what I am thinking. As no one cares in my household. Especially my sister. She’s a fucking b!+ch when it comes to me talking. If it’s not about her or her husband coming to America she can’t stand the conversation and changes the subject to where it’s back on her. And forget talking if he FaceTimes her. She talks really fucking loud and makes sure it’s the conversation piece. Everything evolves around her. Our dad made sure she felt like the fucking princess and got her way. I always got yelled at, told I was useless, made sure I felt second class compared to her. My mom tells me that was his way of telling me I would make it on my own. I was strong willed. While she was the delicate flower who needed men to do everything for her. I used to work on cars, he was a mechanic and taught me a lot but with this pain I can’t do it and she’s finally grown up enough to understand she can do it too so she’s been fixing vehicles with our step dad. Our dad died years ago. She and our step dad get along like thieves. I don’t. My mother and step dad smoke like chimneys. And I have an allergic reaction to it not tested for it yet, but I’m sure it will come up positive too. So I just hang by myself in my home office. I have one she doesn’t. I mean we share it, but she doesn’t use it. Just stacks shit on her desk miles high. I like it, she never has room to do any homework so I get the office to myself which is somewhat peaceful as I can listen to my own music and not have to listen to her and her husband video chat or listen to his damn talking texts like dude type that shit out. His voice permeates our house just like hers does. Got to make sure everyone can hear what their talking about. Thank God! She doesn’t talk about sex life anymore. Like I really don’t care you like rubbing your mans balls till he falls asleep. Keep that shit to yourself. We grew up in conservative Texas. When our parents tried the birds and bees conversation I was legit out. I was like I’m good. Don’t need to know. I’ll figure it out if and when it comes into play. I do NOT want to hear my parents try to talk to me about sex. Thank the Lord google came out years ago before I had any boys interested in me.

He is awesome with our kids, they all love him and he helps out but he is a lazy unmotivated 30-something and I'm sick of it. He has always gone back and forth (or so I think he has gotten sober a couple times he might just be better at hiding it) between using cough syrup and being sober, but it has effed up his head, he doesn't view it as getting high he views it as his ""meditation"" and believes he fights demons and evil spirits to free the trapped good spirits and has on more than one occasion told my wife that he is a saver of humanity or something to that effect, years ago when he was back on his bullshit, he even called the cops because he heard a girl screaming and when they couldn't find anyone he realized it was a ""trapped spirit"" of a girl living in the crawl space under his duplex. His last big delusion was that he caused the tsunami in Japan because around that time he was high on cough syrup and was ""walking across the ocean floor"" when he lost concentration and hit a wall which sent out a huge shock wave and caused the tsunami, he believes this to his core and kept ""meditating""  because like I said earlier he fights evil spirits to free the trapped good spirits and because he caused the tsunami that killed a lot of people he had to free their spirits. He lost his girlfriend and everything around that time because of said bullshit. I know he is using again, and while I believe everyone is entilted to their beliefs this shit is just to far. The thing that bothers me the most is how it effects my wife because if she doesn't pretend to buy into his shit she is worried he will cut her off and not talk to her ever again and she obviously wants to maintain a relationship with her brother. He is a selfish asshole who believes he is selfless and righteous. I believe and have for a long time that he should be examined and probably medicated to help balance him out. My favorite part of all of this is the 2 year cycle is seems to come in, he will be homeless and jobless for a couple years, ""camping"" and ""meditating"" then he wants to ""get his life together"" and used to move in with friends but has torched all of those bridges with all the aforementioned bullshit, he last moved in with their dad but low and behold, same bullshit and now he is here starting the same bullshit. Part of me wishes he would either get the help he desperately needs or that he would just disappear because I am tired of how this effects my wife and heartache it causes her because he is her brother after all. Thanks for the vent, I have talked to her about it but I can't be this brutal about it because while she sees it too, it's harder for her.

He has always gone back and forth (or so I think he has gotten sober a couple times he might just be better at hiding it) between using cough syrup and being sober, but it has effed up his head, he doesn&amp;#39;t view it as getting high he views it as his &amp;quot;meditation&amp;quot; and believes he fights demons and evil spirits to free the trapped good spirits and has on more than one occasion told my wife that he is a saver of humanity or something to that effect, years ago when he was back on his bullshit, he even called the cops because he heard a girl screaming and when they couldn&amp;#39;t find anyone he realized it was a &amp;quot;trapped spirit&amp;quot; of a girl living in the crawl space under his duplex. His last big delusion was that he caused the tsunami in Japan because around that time he was high on cough syrup and was &amp;quot;walking across the ocean floor&amp;quot; when he lost concentration and hit a wall which sent out a huge shock wave and caused the tsunami, he believes this to his core and kept &amp;quot;meditating&amp;quot;  because like I said earlier he fights evil spirits to free the trapped good spirits and because he caused the tsunami that killed a lot of people he had to free their spirits. He lost his girlfriend and everything around that time because of said bullshit. I know he is using again, and while I believe everyone is entilted to their beliefs this shit is just to far. The thing that bothers me the most is how it effects my wife because if she doesn&amp;#39;t pretend to buy into his shit she is worried he will cut her off and not talk to her ever again and she obviously wants to maintain a relationship with her brother. He is a selfish asshole who believes he is selfless and righteous. I believe and have for a long time that he should be examined and probably medicated to help balance him out. My favorite part of all of this is the 2 year cycle is seems to come in, he will be homeless and jobless for a couple years, &amp;quot;camping&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;meditating&amp;quot; then he wants to &amp;quot;get his life together&amp;quot; and used to move in with friends but has torched all of those bridges with all the aforementioned bullshit, he last moved in with their dad but low and behold, same bullshit and now he is here starting the same bullshit. Part of me wishes he would either get the help he desperately needs or that he would just disappear because I am tired of how this effects my wife and heartache it causes her because he is her brother after all. Thanks for the vent, I have talked to her about it but I can&amp;#39;t be this brutal about it because while she sees it too, it&amp;#39;s harder for her.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in a constant fear I’m going nowhere in life.

Endless hours of my life were dedicated to documentaries and books. I spent much of my free time in the libraries and stuff just absorbing information about the natural world.

I joined the military out of school, however, and had to place my career on the back burner. In the navy, I served as an FMF corpsman and unfortunately saw a lot of gruesome shit. All of this eventually led to severe anxiety and eventually, when I got it through my head that something was wrong, saw a psychiatrist at the VA who diagnosed me with PTSD. By this point in my life, I had gotten out of the military and had been working at my hometown emergency room. There, I was privy to witnessing the tragedy of the opioid epidemic first hand. People I had partied with in high school were dying in front of me. One of my best friends who shared summers with me killed himself this way leaving me with only the memories of riding our bikes together to the 711 to get slurpees. Eventually, this continued on in our community so pervasively that we couldn’t even organize our reunion as those who were local and able to attend could only be found in graveyards or within urns.

It was then that I finally got the courage to go back to school. My doctors said that the work environment I was in was not suitable for a healthy emotional state and they convinced me to finally chase my childhood dream to be a scientist. I got the courage to do it and at the age of thirty, I left my job and went to school full time. To say this was a rush of anxiety and fear would be an understatement. 

The first semester wasn’t as smooth as I’d hoped. I passed one of my classes well enough but I wasn’t prepared for the workload. So, the next semester, I chose to be more conscious of my time management. But every time I had algebra, I would freak out. For no other class did this to me. The anxiety and fear led to another failed attempt. The second failed attempt at algebra certainly didn’t improve my mental station. But, in the face of adversity, I enrolled a third time. 

This time, the professor started out by putting problems from the final exam on the board and telling us to complete them. After ten minutes, she told us to put our pencils down. She then stated that if we were unable to finish all of these problems, we should drop the class and if we had a problem with it, we would have to take it up with the dean since she was the department chair. Some of this was MyMathLab which is Satan incarnate as far as computer programs are concerned. For those who haven’t had the pleasure, basically, if your answer is right and your math is on-point but there is a space after an open parentheses, it marks you wrong but doesn’t tell you why leaving you to do and redo the problem incorrect ways to try and do it right yet, 100% of her homework grades were dependent upon this program. Suffice it to say I’m doing terribly and about to fail a third time.

I cannot honestly describe how gut-wrenching it is to have to change course on a childhood dream because I am simply not good enough; because I couldn’t get through a course that so many others can easily slide through. I’m not even all the sure that I have an appropriate GPA to get approval for another semester if I do choose to change majors. and that is if I can figure out where to go at this point. I feel demoralized, defeated, and full of shame. Sincerely, I don’t know what to do at this point. The people around me keep telling me the same shit. “Hang in there.” “It will be okay.” But these are just responses that I can’t accept because it isn’t okay. I’m more lost now than I have ever been and wish I could figure out what to do. If I can’t even pass algebra to get an associates degree, what then are my options? These are the moments I wish I had the answers and for the first time in my life, I don’t. I have none. And I’m terrified.

That even if you hold out your hand  numerous times, people never take it?  That you end up left with an empty space inside? Honestly, I feel that every day and I am beginning to think that I’m not good at connecting with people… not in the way I want.

I remember, there was a time before I moved… that I have numerous friends. I was the center of attention in school. Made friends easily, and wasn’t always ‘alone’. Even if my own dad treated me like I wasn’t important, I didn’t feel the pain.. Because I could make a connection with others around me. I was happy, regardless of the abuse, I went through….

Than.. we moved… new place away from those I loved. From those that I was close with, and the place I could fit in. The new school I went to… slowly became hell. I thought I would make friends, just like I did in my old town… but that wasn’t the case.. Before, I could try.. I was labeled the ‘Outsider’. I was a very cute child, and pretty outgoing. I had confidence in myself, and wasn’t afraid…. I tried many times, and it never worked out. My birthday Parties, which use to be filled with my friends… became just siblings and parents. It was fine, because we were new to this place. I didn’t worry about it..because I had my sister, whom was my best friend.

And as Time went on and the abuse became worse… I lost confidence and stopped trying to make friends. Instead, I wanted to fit in. Find a place that will just accept me, and nothing worked. It all became… fruitless. Instead, the bullying became worse. .. and the happy child… became filled with despair, hate and anger…  I never had a say in anything, so I lashed out and became the bully, at the time everyone was picking on this kid… but that made things worse for me… . I’m not proud of being a bully, I was angry and hurt and wanted someone to see it… but, when my dad found out.. It became a nightmare… he wanted to teach me another painful lesson.I remember… He bound my legs and blindfolded my sister… at first my sister and I laughed thinking it was fun… seeing as we’re kids, and not old enough to understand… but this made him angry… and since I was a child he hated… he made it worse for me… He made sure I couldn’t move, see or hear…  I can’t remember what happened next, but I am 100% sure it wasn’t good, because I developed severe panic attacks and anxiety after that.. And an intense fear of men. IT still makes me shake typing this… and I can’t remember what else happened.

After that… I stopped bullying the kid, instead my hate grew.. And I stopped being close with my sister. She made living in that house harder… because of her, I’d get a beating… when she cut the dog’s hair and placed it in front of my door…. He grabbed the belt with many metal holes… and used it. Calling me a liar, when I wasn’t lying…. It hurt so much and I cried a lot… the worst part is when he found out it was actually my sister… He pretended to punish her. While I had to hide my bruises…

Time went on, until finally my mom threw him out, he had tried to kill her again. To be honest, I was happy he was gone… but I was angry at my own mom for not doing it sooner… That’s when she chose to put us in therapy… but honestly, that didn’t help me… at all. The only thing that helped me was Anger Management. The one thing, my case worker forced me to attend.  I found ways to let out my anger.. So, it died down a bit… but not all the way. My sister and I… became mortal enemies…. To the point, when we fought.. We never held back…. Turns out, no matter how I tried to fix it… that relationship would remain broken… because she chooses to keep it that way… short explanation; I apologized, 100% for what I did and even tried to make amends… her response “I don’t recognize as my sister, so don’t act like it” To this day, when I slip up and try… she destroys it. Honestly, now I can’t stand her… she took after our dad…During the years, I tried to make friends, but the bullying continued… not matter what school. By Middle school, I gained weight and choose to go to a Leadership school. I wanted to improve myself, there… and work on disciple… JROTC was mandatory.  So, I worked to try to be apart of that, but… I never did well in it. In fact… when it came to the fitness tests… the guys had to help the girl up to the bar…(weird tbh) and when it came to me… they all refused… Of course, my teacher was furious with them and told them do it…I was embarrassed and already hated myself… so, I refused.. And accepted the 0. I had hoped… that school would help me… in some ways, it did… but in other ways, not so much.Mmh… I ended up with a really good friend, someone I loved hanging out with…. We were always together.. Until the end of middle school…. That’s where she cut all ties. I never got to talk to her again…  She cut me out of her life…. That would be the second time someone did that to me…

Highschool came around… and it was alright. Not as bad or tragic as the other school experiences. Everyone treated me like a mod character, which I enjoyed.  I gained friends, and even a new best friend… that lasted until a year ago… when she posted photos of her wedding… I was there when they got engaged… honestly, She and I had always been close together, never apart and really good friends… but yea… third time in my life…A year after graduation… I found someone special… He was different… and was like fire to me. He was on a different level than I was and that made me excited to become close to him. As the years went by, he walked away from me 2xs… honestly, he walked away from me… everytime I needed him.. He’s a very selfish man, with a king complex… that’s for sure. Anything… I choose not to turn back, so I went forward… I hated my job and didn\[‘t have nothing going for me. So, I found a new one last year, I was torn between cutting my hours at the old one, to get my full month of training in… or prolonging the training…. Until, as if by fate, they let me go after my 4th anniversary… honestly, when I was given the news about my termination from the company… I was relieved.. And also… very happy about it. … granted I did cry for an hour after losing it, but that’s because I am actually a crybaby when it comes to losing things… but being let go was the best thing to happen to me… because I found a job…. That doesn’t make me hate myself and.. What’s amazing is… I get paid 3xs more… for less hours. It’s extremely fun and I can be social all the time….

But I still can’t help but feel lonely… I haven’t had sex with anyone and I’m almost 31… I still get scared of men, but it’s a lot less than before. My anxiety has become.. Almost nonexistent, with rare flare ups. When I think about this… I get frustrated with myself.. But I don’t want a meaningless fling..,, honestly, no guy has ever asked me out… except for one… but that was a dead end. I just wanted a friend. Lol.. granted.. There are some guys that talk to me… but I refuse to sleep with anyone, because it’s really pointless. I prefer a wholesome connection.. To a sensational one… after all, I know those types of relationships do exist and it’s amazing… because I actually feel whole in them… of course, this is with ONE guy… and the only one i was with…

Anyway… long story short.. I miss having someone close to me… boyfriend or just a friend… I miss it…. But it seems… I’m probably destined to be alone… and it sucks... because I really did try to connect with others...

Also, Therapy doens't help... in my opinion, it never has.... but that's a completely different venting all together... and I don't want to keep into that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like you’re lost in a sea of loneliness? That even if you hold out your hand  numerous times, people never take it?  That you end up left with an empty space inside? Honestly, I feel that every day and I am beginning to think that I’m not good at connecting with people… not in the way I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember, there was a time before I moved… that I have numerous friends. I was the center of attention in school. Made friends easily, and wasn’t always ‘alone’. Even if my own dad treated me like I wasn’t important, I didn’t feel the pain.. Because I could make a connection with others around me. I was happy, regardless of the abuse, I went through….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than.. we moved… new place away from those I loved. From those that I was close with, and the place I could fit in. The new school I went to… slowly became hell. I thought I would make friends, just like I did in my old town… but that wasn’t the case.. Before, I could try.. I was labeled the ‘Outsider’. I was a very cute child, and pretty outgoing. I had confidence in myself, and wasn’t afraid…. I tried many times, and it never worked out. My birthday Parties, which use to be filled with my friends… became just siblings and parents. It was fine, because we were new to this place. I didn’t worry about it..because I had my sister, whom was my best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as Time went on and the abuse became worse… I lost confidence and stopped trying to make friends. Instead, I wanted to fit in. Find a place that will just accept me, and nothing worked. It all became… fruitless. Instead, the bullying became worse. .. and the happy child… became filled with despair, hate and anger…  I never had a say in anything, so I lashed out and became the bully, at the time everyone was picking on this kid… but that made things worse for me… .

At first I was a little apprehensive due to being burned in the past but I enjoy talking to him and look forward to hearing from him. 

We scheduled our first date to be dinner and movie, it was a movie we both really wanted to see. The day before our scheduled date he was texting me back and forth regarding how he was excited and where we should go eat and what time should we meet up. Then the day of the date he says that it's too hot to go out to eat even though we hadn't made final plans yet. Then he tried to change what movie we wanted to see.

After going back and forth for a little bit we decided to stick to the movie we agreed on and go to the 6 show. At at 2 p.m. he was running errands  and we were texting back and forth about where we should meet and he told me when he left just or he would call me and that he was super excited to see me. At 3 p.m. I text him asking him if he forgot about me, got no response. At 4:30 p.m. I text asking if he changed his mind, got no response. At 5:30 I called him and his phone went straight to voicemail, and playing off of a hunch I called him on my son's phone and his phone rang. To which then I text and said that I can take a hint and I will be deleting his contact information.

So my reason for posting all of this was to ask what was the point of it? He pursued me, he made the arrangements, he went through all the effort to get my attention and to get me interested in him......... just took ghost me before our first date? What was the point?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this short but I really need some advice or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in my late teens/early 20's my brother and I worked at a fast food restaurant, and sometimes hung out with some of my co workers. One night my brother and I were out with 3 others, and he was driving. We decided to go to the restaurant and see who's working and say hi. This restaurant had 2 drive thru windows, and my brother decided he wanted to joke around. The second someone came to the window to say hi he drove to the second window sorta cutting off the conversation. Then when he got to the second window and someone came, he did the same thing but reversed back the the first. He did this back and forth thing a two times and everyone inside was laughing. I kept telling him to stop since he was backing up too fast and he could crash into another car going through the drive thru. Hes sorta in the moment and doesn't listen to me and keeps doing it. So my brother is at the second drive thru, and backs up for the third time, and we hear a crash. The car stalls as if its caught on something, and were all confused. Here we find out one of the girls in the back decided to get out of the car right when he decided to reverse and the door hit one of the metal posts on the corner of the drive thru. Her pinky also happened to get caught between the door and the post, and was cut really bad. She was sitting in the rear passenger door behind the driver, and just got out without saying anything. We all got out to see what happened, and saw the door all bent up, and the girl holding her pinky in pain. She went to the hospital to get stitches and we were all wondering why the hell did she get out of the car? Anyway after that innocent the girl blamed my brother for ""trying to cut off her finger,"" and would always bring it up every now and then. She would spin the story to make herself out to be the victim, and then others would feel bad, and get pissed at my brother. It was both of their fault for the accident and my brother felt horrible for what happened. What pissed me off is other people would believe her even though they didn't know the whole story. You can imagine how frustrating that can be.... This all took place about 10 years ago but I still remember it vividly.

Anyway a few months ago I'm at the doctors, waiting in the examination room and guess who walks in? Yup, she happens to be an assistant nurse at the doctors office I newly switched over to. I havent seen her in so long, and she decides to make small talk with me. Even though I never really liked her, I remain civil. Another nurse comes in and she says "" oh by the way, I told her about how you tried to cut off my finger."" The other nurse sorta looks at me like she didnt want anything to do with the conversation and keeps to herself. I reply ( trying to keep it cool mind you) ""you mean the freak accident when you got out of a moving car?"" She replies ""not true"", and I go "" and It was my brother who drove...not me."" She sorta chuckles it off, but I remain looking at her like WTF. I mean why the hell would you bring that up after so long? Especially in front of others. It just got me so angry, and I switched doctors. Anyway, I just needed to vent about this and see if maybe anyone can relate. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have a tendency to reflect on bad things in the past that happened to me.

You arent different from other girls but instead, your making semi-sexist stereotypical comments on how you think you view girls. For example, what makes you think only guys can play video games, drink alcohol, party late at night, and other things? Honestly, what makes you different apart from the ""other girls"" you so call mention? Are you saying your too edgy to listen to kpop and instead listen to Billie Ellish, Green Day, or any rapper? Are you saying your too tomboy to wear dresses and instead want to wear ripped up jeans, gloves with the fingers cut out, and a beanie? Are you saying your too weird to be watching Housewives of whatever and Kardashians and instead want to watch The Office or cartoons?

&amp;#x200B;

Im sorry if Im violating the rules by being a dick in my statement but y'all gotta stop making comments by saying ""Im not like other girls"" just because you picked up a video game controller and started playing Call of Duty or Counterstrike, wearing jeans at a party instead of a skirt or a dress, and especially calling other girls sluts because they're going out wearing skin tight or revealing clothes and having fifty pounds of makeup on their face.

At this point I don’t even know if I want a girlfriend, just sex, or to experience romantic things




Long version:

My thoughts have been all over the place ever since I had a rather strange dream last week. The dream itself wasn’t all that strange, the events were actually quite clear, but still. I’m not going into detail of the dream, since it’s not all that important. Anyways, before that dream, I was pretty much always thinking about how I want, or maybe even need (in my head) a girlfriend. To me, having a girlfriend sounds like a portal to happiness. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not some depressed af person, but if anything, I do feel down quite a lot. Most of the time, that’s because I just feel lonely and think a girlfriend can fix this.
However, ever since that dream, I’ve been thinking about how I don’t need a girlfriend and I might as well settle for just sex. Considering that I’m a 19 year old virgin who has never had a girlfriend before, I feel like it sounds pretty fair. I mean, I know it’s not something to worry about, but people age 15-16 are out there having actual relationships and having more sex than I can imagine.
At this point, I might just start being a desperate piece of shit and get my ass on Tinder, be direct with all the matches I get (if I even get any) and probably just get down to business with it. Surely losing my virginity is actually easier than I think.
However, by just doing that, I’m kinda going against my sort of ideal that, since I’ve been single and virgin for so long, I might as well wait till I can do it with someone I actually like/love, which would make the wait actually worth it.
I’m not really asking for advice here, but it sure as hell is welcome. If anything, I’m just happy I wrote this shit out for myself and got it off my chest.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short version:&lt;/p&gt;

I've never been diagnosed with depression and I honestly don't even know whether to wonder if I have it or just to accept the fact that I'm lazy. I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point about it. 
I never feel motivated enough to get up and start putting things away. I try so hard but it's so exhausting just to put a few things away. I've been struggling with problems similar to this for a while now. I never feel motivated enough to clean the house either, I can barely even get myself out of the bed. My mother always just calls me lazy and blames it on the internet but honestly I just sit in my bed and think a lot. 
I also find it mentally exhausting and almost pointless to take care of my basic hygiene. I almost never shower or wash my face, and everybody always tells me it's disgusting. I know it is but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't just take a shower because it's not supposed to be hard. 
Getting up and leaving the house is something my mom always forces me to do but it always makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around people makes me uncomfortable, I barely ever talk to my mom and she always takes personal offense to it. She always makes me feel bad about it and guilts me into hanging out with her  by saying that I'm so ungrateful because I have a perfectly good mom and I never talk to her. But then we argue about me being unmotivated and she doesn't take me seriously. She just says I'm lazy and doing nothing will make me feel worse. 
I've been becoming underweight recently because I never really feel hungry and don't often leave my room. My mom makes me feel worse about that too, instead of being kind enough to ask why I never eat she just threatens to send me to the hospital and screams at me. I'm only 90 pounds while being 5'5 and you can see most of my bones. 
I feel as if my ""depression"" ((if I even have it)) is making my mom hate me. She works full time and goes to college and I guess it stresses her out that I never clean up or get anything done. She gets angry because I don't make myself food since I don't Really care and she has to force me to eat instead of sleeping or doing schoolwork. 
I think I'm just a burden on her and my family since I can barely even take care of myself or act like a normal human being. She even blames me for losing all of my friends because I can't even act normal and I'm always upset about something. I'm starting to think that this isn't even depression and I'm just a shitty human being. There's even times I wonder if I should just run away or end my life because I'm incapable of being happy and it's hurting people around me.

You were re-diagnosed with cancer (for a second time). I remember the first time you told me you had had cancer at one point(probably the second time we saw each other), unknowing that the cancer was back in your body, that you wouldn’t treat it again. It took too much out of you. It was too painful. It was just too much. 

It all happened fast. We fell in love fast, which I thought was lust but turns out to be something I’ve never really experienced before. An instant connection that led to instant feelings that led into instant love. 

What else happened fast, was the cancer coming back into your life.

It could have been a false positive you hoped. But it came back worse than expected, a lot worse. You hadn’t even discussed options with a doctor by the time you went to the hospital. You’re back now. You seem fine until you get a ridiculous amount of pain all at once. 

I watch from afar, closely, whatever you ask of me. But I know what’s coming. I can feel it. Maybe I’m wrong for being so pessimistic.

Next week, you talk about options. Treatments, decisions, things that you don’t want me to have to see. 

You’ve been honest, I will not be your lover if it’s bad or it gets bad. It’s already bad, but we just don’t know how bad. I will trust you, but it will be difficult to let go of this. 

This isn’t getting in the way of my day to day life. You told me not to let it, and i am trying my best not too. I’ve never lost anyone close to me before. 

What comforts me is the fact if you do pass, we experienced our own little infinity. Which is too cheesy, and I don’t like cheesy things, but it’s comforting to know the time we would have spent together was amazing and full of love and memories. 

What doesn’t comfort me is what you’ll be leaving behind. I could care less about me. What about your family? What about colleagues that love you and cherish you? 

I just have to trust you know best. I have to trust that you will make the right choice for you, and no one else. I will hurt, but I won’t be broken. 

I will be there for you when you need, and distance when it gets too much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

Bf and I live on the first floor, we have a separate entrance but only one room that is done - bedroom, and because of that we have to go down if we want to go to the bathroom or to eat. 

That sucks a lot, because first of all, I'm very anxious and I'm used to being alone, and now I'm in that house surrounded with people, second I really feel uncomfortable about laundry and the fact that his mom or grandma wake up in half past 5 and get shit done which includes hanging laundry so it can dry (my biggest prob is underwear, I just don't want anyone touching it), so I recently decided to wash my boyfriend's and mine clothes separately when his mom is working, so I can feel more comfortable.. BUT

The fact that his sister is a very annoying, spoiled slutty bitch (18yo btw), and that she's not ever asked to do shit really bothers the fuck out of me. And also even tho I started washing our clothes separately their mom still asks me to hang their laundry.. 

I'm currently not working so I'm home all the time, studying and stuff, and since I'm not currently making any money or helping with it, I do tend to help with everything I can, but it really bothers me when their mom tells me to hang laundry even tho it contains 80% of his sisters thongs and bras (that I of course don't want to even look at not to speak of me touching it) even tho the princess is sitting in her room probably taking selfies. 
The girl even wears thongs to the pool!
Huhh, writing this down makes me feel even more angry.. 

Also, what gets me really pissed is when their mom asks me to make lunch and in a certain time because her princess will be home soon and hungry.. I just loose my damn mind over that.. 

The little bitch also took some stuff from me when bf and I were in another country working, without even asking including a makeup palette that she than borrowed to a friend who broke it, even tho we asked her if she took it and even tho we were looking for that palette for about 6 months.. Also I could tell she wore some of my clothes.. 

When I borrowed my kit for fake nails to her, she completely ruined and stained everything and it took her also about 6 months to return it all (and we live in the same fucking house!).. And I keep my stuff very neat and tidy, I'm a perfectionist, yeah..

Look, every time she does smt that's not cool my boyfriend sticks up for me and argues with her and their mom (bcs mom stands on her daughter's side no matter what obviously) about it, but little shit is just unbelievably rude and spoiled that you can't make a simple deal or agreement with her. 

Basically I told my boyfriend that when we finish a bathroom and a kitchen on our floor (which is going to be done in a couple of months, I hope so) that I won't do anything else for anyone of them (his family) except for the two of us, and he basically understands and is totally okay with that, which is good. 
Also, if they continue to ask for favours, we'll move out. 

Our goal is to make some money and start building our own house, and I can't wait for that, and I hope that it'll happen in a couple of years tops..

Yet she can invite him out to get wasted on the weekends and try to force him into drunken impulse tattoos. Thankfully the attempts just piss him off. I dont mind tattoos by any means, but getting a random tattoo on impulse while shit faced is stupid and trashy to me. Not to mention hers look terrible. Bad lines, crooked, etc. I&amp;#39;m just so sick of her existence in my life. She is a toxic person in every way and I honestly hope she goes through with the divorce shes considering so she can finally have to take care of herself for once and fall flat on her ass. I would love to see the world take a bite out of her once she doesnt get to really on having married rich to breeze her way through life.&lt;/p&gt;

​

My life recently has been a puddle of - meh. I find wanting to do things difficult, even things that sound fun like hiking or swimming. I am short with my SO when I would like to be kind. I lack the willpower to get myself outside when the day is pleasant. Through each day I find myself wanting so much more than what I have and needing to create when instead I consume. I play games because it's easy, I don't have to move or think about the things I am responsible for. I ignore my surroundings and lack initiation.

​

I go to the rock gym almost 3 times a week to get fun exercise in but while I'm there I can only will myself to try so hard before wanting to lay down and sleep. I feel like I'm wading through sludge just to do simple tasks. Even as I type this I can't help but feel like there is a ball and chain attached to the base of my skull. A tension headache is what the doctors called it.

​

For the past 6 years this headache has been gnawing at my psyche. The pain can range anywhere from a 1 on my better days to a 4 when I am stressed in life. 24/7. 6 years. Well anyways it can be more than a little discouraging to do anything when I imagine the amount of energy I have to exert just to get through the headache and fatigue.

​

I have a CPAP but I have been struggling to use it for the past 2 years. I either tear it off in my sleep or I choose not to wear it at all. I became hopeless when my doctor said that the CPAP was making my CSA worse and that using the CPAP may eventually get better if I use it more. Well instead of taking that as a challenge to try the CPAP I let myself fall to the bottom of a well. Mentally of course.

​

Everyday, despite wanting to live (something I will never stop doing regardless of the thoughts of death being easy) I think often about what I wish I had. I think about committing myself to my goals and aspirations but day after day, I let my problems manifest into an excuse.

I sacrifice some of my time just to see her &amp; make sure she’s happy. But I still feel like I’m failing as a boyfriend. 
I don’t know what to do. All I ever asked for is for her to be able to have a conversation with me, listen to and talk with me about my problems, don’t lie to me, and put some effort into us. It’s like she gives up so fast when we argue and quick to leave the convo and go hours without talking instead of trying to talk the situation out. Maybe it’s me, maybe I’m not satisfying her or something. 
She’s a nice girl and good girlfriend. We’ve been together for a good 1 and 3 months now. I know I have high standards but I lowered them just for her so we can see eye to eye. She’s four hours away and when she do come back down here she’s always to busy for me. When I do see her it’s only a few hours here and there. Maybe I’m thinking to much into it. 

And now she’s just now gotten into church and she once said “our relationship isn’t pleasing to god”. It’s not like I don’t believe in god. I just avoid going to church cause the times that I have went to church I always got shunned away. So I avoid to go and just learn on my own. We also have sex before marriage and she wants to stop which is fine but she didn’t even talk to me about it first.
Maybe I’m not meant to be loved. If a girl who I gave everything too and even helped pay for some of her college bills can’t give me the simple things &amp; my own mom leaving me. I’m just not meant to be loved. I failed as a son and boyfriend.

And most of us, both by action and by statement of our behavior, all tend to show up on time. 

So, the eight of us had decided to come to my place at bla time. 1,5 hour earlier, i get a message from A that they are going to be late with like an hour/maybe closer to two, but they would show up if we were still hanging. That's great, then i know! 

The clock is ticking, when the time for when we are supposed to meet strikes, I am snapchatting (only pictures, no text) with B, and since I see them not leaving their home I ask them when they are coming. B tells me they feel really bad because it's the time of year their grandfather passed away. Ok, maybe in the latest minute to inform me, but I'm okay with that because I understand they felt bad and maybe couldn't gather the energy to inform me. 

A few minutes later, C and D inform me they are just going to get a quick lunch and then come over (at the time I thought they were just going to pick up lunch and bring it to my place). Time keeps ticking, noone shows up. Friend E doesn't say anything about coming or not coming, but I didn't ask because we had set the time and place, and I don't want to hound them. But I'm sitting there and no one's there yet. So 20 min later, I'm feeling like this is not going to happen (I know, 20 min is not that much really, but in a friend group were everyone is at latest 10 min late at worst... Yeah.) By now I'm pretty sure E has totally forgot it, cause they seem to still be in the town over (snapchat-map is stalker-map). 

40 min after we are supposed to meet, F calls me. 
“Whats happenin?”
“Nothing, cause no one is here…” and then i continue to explain why noone is there. Friend F are apparently with C and D in town and eating lunch. I had forgotten that F was meeting C earlier for stuff, and D lives in the same building as C so they left for lunch together. And about there the call ends. They did not ask me to come out to them (nothing more than 5-10 min walk) even though they now knew I’m sitting alone, when they were supposed to be there. And they had ditched me for lunch and didn’t ask me to join when they learned I was stood up by kind of EVERYONE.

5 min later same person text me saying it’s better we cancels the hanging at my place. And mentally I’m like, no bloody shit Sherlock, I had that figured by like 15 min after noone showed because I know how we work.

And F was at the time with A and B, my closest friends in the area. They didn’t write or call me that they were going to be late personally, they just called 40 min later and then cancelled the entire thing probably because they felt like they had hung out enough with C and D, and hanging out with me was to much of a hassle or something...

And at that point i just was so frustrated and disappointed, 7 friends was supposed to come over. But I’m dissed by 4 of them, and 1 is feeling to ill to come and 1 is not sure if they will make it here! I didn’t exactly feel valued as a friend...

Eventually A came over, (1,5 hours later) they had missed my message about the hanging not happening and noone showing up. I got to vent and after hanging for some time with A felt better.

TL;DR 
I read a few comments in a thread talking about friends being late without telling you, and couldn’t stop thinking about this, were the biggest hurt was caused one of my closest friends in the area at the time (that later friendship-broke up with me, hence the bigger frustration then necessary for the situation today).

&lt;p&gt;40 min after we are supposed to meet, F calls me. 
“Whats happenin?”
“Nothing, cause no one is here…” and then i continue to explain why noone is there. Friend F are apparently with C and D in town and eating lunch. I had forgotten that F was meeting C earlier for stuff, and D lives in the same building as C so they left for lunch together. And about there the call ends. They did not ask me to come out to them (nothing more than 5-10 min walk) even though they now knew I’m sitting alone, when they were supposed to be there. And they had ditched me for lunch and didn’t ask me to join when they learned I was stood up by kind of EVERYONE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 min later same person text me saying it’s better we cancels the hanging at my place. And mentally I’m like, no bloody shit Sherlock, I had that figured by like 15 min after noone showed because I know how we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And F was at the time with A and B, my closest friends in the area. They didn’t write or call me that they were going to be late personally, they just called 40 min later and then cancelled the entire thing probably because they felt like they had hung out enough with C and D, and hanging out with me was to much of a hassle or something...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at that point i just was so frustrated and disappointed, 7 friends was supposed to come over. But I’m dissed by 4 of them, and 1 is feeling to ill to come and 1 is not sure if they will make it here! I didn’t exactly feel valued as a friend...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually A came over, (1,5 hours later) they had missed my message about the hanging not happening and noone showing up. I got to vent and after hanging for some time with A felt better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR 
I read a few comments in a thread talking about friends being late without telling you, and couldn’t stop thinking about this, were the biggest hurt was caused one of my closest friends in the area at the time (that later friendship-broke up with me, hence the bigger frustration then necessary for the situation today). I and 7 friends decided to meet at my place, only 1 showed up.&lt;/p&gt;

The mother of the woman who very nearly completely destroyed my ability to feel feelings. 

 Without going into a whole bunch of historical information, none of which I actually want to dig through to recount right now, the woman I am referring to, chose a person convicted of possessing indecent images of children, over me. I gave her an ultimatum, saying its either me or him, and she chose him. She chose a sicko, a pervert, a fucking degenerate, over me, and though I know I am far from perfect, I did NOT deserve that. I can think of few things in my whole life, that have been as damned near to destroying even the healthiest parts of my ego, as that was. She and I had been sharing a bed regularly for five years or so at that point. I could have dealt with the lack of exclusivity (I wasn't the only one, and that was all understood before I began my association with her), I could have dealt with all the other things that were insane about that woman, and kept doing it all the rest of my life, but she took up with a pervert, I called her on it, and she ditched me like a gum wrapper. 

 I carried that woman home from bars when the cabs refused to take her, because she had managed to puke on herself after drinking too much. I helped her gut and redecorate her house, I watched over her when she was in danger of self harming, cleaned up when she did hurt herself, and stopped her when I caught her trying to. I could have dealt with all the out workings of the damage caused to her by having a mother who is intensely damaged herself, and I would have helped with all of that. I accepted things I did not like about the situation between me and her, namely the lack of exclusivity, all because life with her in it was better than life without, no matter how hard it might have been. And she chose scum over me. Scum who had never done anything for her, and, just in case it was not clear, is SCUM. 

 And her mother wants to come into my store, and tell me about how the family is? Here is what I felt like saying:

 Well, madam, I don't care that your other, younger daughter is now pregnant with her boyfriends child, and I do not care that the foul, degenerate she cunt you birthed first is having money troubles, has learned to drive, or any other bloody thing that you have to say, because if the lot of you became on fire all of a sudden, I would not even call the authorities. I would laugh until I were sure you were dead, light a cigarette off your burning carcass, and merrily carry on my day, you fuck. 

 Of course I did not say all those things, because I am a gentleman. That also pisses me off. But neither thing pisses me off as much as the fact that these things CAN still piss me off.

A lot of leftover stress and anxiety, but also a lot of really good, proud-of-myself feelings. So, here you go.

My old boss at the University I work for was a total DICKWAD and made me feel like complete crap for even the smallest mistakes, things that should have been expected for someone who hadn't even worked there a full year, but instead he just came at me and made me feel totally worthless. I'm pretty smart, I'm a fast learner, I don't make a TON of mistakes in my work. Not at all saying I'm perfect, but I just do good work, especially once I know exactly what I'm doing. Mistakes are few and far between, and I constantly try to do better. But this guy just had it out for me, and would focus on the smallest things, like a mismarked spreadsheet or not having 15 full days of sick time saved up (I have migraines, that I have FMLA for, and he was still pissed that I wasn't able to save up sick and vacation time). He refused to even give me 2 hours of vacation time, when requested over 2 weeks in advance, because I did not have 15 full days of time saved up. (for reference, it will take me 1.5 years without taking one hour of vacation to save up 15 days with the way I accrue it. So he was essentially denying any vacation for 1.5 years). If I had been smart, I would have kept record of all this and the Union would have had a field day. But I'm a moron and didn't do that until it was too late.

So anyway, I took the first job that came my way within the university, which was also one I had had my eye on for a while. When I left the old job, my boss told me I would not be successful in anything I did (I was 23 at the time, 24 now). I'm a young woman doing her best to pursue a career at her university, in spite of no college education, and he flat out told me I would not be successful. Dick.

The new boss hired me without even an interview, because I had worked with her in the past and she thought I did an excellent job and wanted me on her staff as soon as possible.

I've been here for 7 months now, *aced* every review I've had, and my new boss adores me. She says I am a fabulous worker, and she is so glad she got me on her staff.

I am the senior most front office staff worker (meaning I am stationed in the front office, my job is as a fiscal admin), and even though I've only been here a few months, I have made myself a resource and the ""go-to"" when something needs resolved, or if someone needs help. I am over 3 other front office workers, and I am flourishing. My migraines are down to 2-3 a month, instead of 2 a week, all of my coworkers enjoy working with me, and they all rely on me for a number of things.

One of the things that my old boss cited as a reason to hate me is because I had not made myself a ""go to"" for anything. But I have to laugh, because even now, 7 months later, I ***still*** get emails about the jobs I used to do in my old position. Still. And I am 100% the ""go to"" in my new office.

I have a ton of flexibility in this new position, even allowing me to work from home when I am too sick to come in but not sick enough to sleep all day (like, I got a nasty cold this weekend and was mostly better by Monday, but still sounded disgusting and wasn't at 100%, so they let me take my financial paperwork home and work from home just because they're awesome). I love it out here, I'm doing really well, and it came with a significant pay raise.

My new boss genuinely wants us all to succeed, and she builds all of us up as best as she can, and she is incredible.

So it feels really FUCKING good to know that it wasn't me, it was my old boss who was an ass, and really FUCKING good to prove him wrong.

Im a young guy, and I fancied a young lady.  She was soon leaving town though, so oh well.  However, about 1-2 weeks before she left, she recovered some half wild kittens that a tomcat made with her dads outdoor farm cat.  

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I would help be alleviating 1 cat.  I'd never been a cat guy, but the kittens were adorable and guys will do stupid things for girls.  

&amp;#x200B;

Something to know about these cats, is due to their first four weeks or so out in the wild, they were not normally behaved cats.  They were extremely shy, skiddish even, around humans.  They were nearly feral.  She had, I think four.  At least two were greyish in color, another one maybe grey, or real dark.  Then there was a runt, calico.  I thought one of the greyest, a female kitten, was cutesy so I grabbed her.  As I was in my car leaving, she calls out to me from her balcony; her cousin who was taking the grey brother cat who paired mine, could no longer take him.  So I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys will do stupid things for girls.   And they were a pair and I didn't want to separate them (the boy was already spoken for, so I didnt want her to not feel left out.  I don't know, I was dumb).  I then regret not taking the runt.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I've got these two terrified demons in my basement.  My basement is in disrepair.  Cluttered with tons of my parents junk.  That's a post for another day.  But all of this clutter makes for perfect kitten hiding spaces.  I dont think I made contact with my cats for the first week of having them.  Slowly they began to open up to me.  I tried my hardest to form a bond with these cats because I felt bad for them.   They were some how already miraculously litter trained, before my friend even gave them to me.  She had them for maybe a week, and either it was because they were already a few weeks old or something, but they just knew to use the litter box.  

&amp;#x200B;

So taking care of them early was easy, just put food and water out for them, change the litter.  Couldn't interact with them.  As the days went by, we'd cuddle a lot, and play around, theyd chase their toys.  It was great.  They would crawl on me, but didnt so much enjoy being picked up.  I still bear scars.  They loved coming to me for attention, but quickly learn to evade me if I was looking for them.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks in though and I needed to take them to the vet.  The moment they knew I was looking actively for theyd go into hiding.   This meant I had to resort to trickery and trapping.  I'd become proficient at this in the coming months as I would need to take them to more vet appointments.  At the vet, they would always be in distress.  They were not comfortable outside of my house.  They were afraid to go outside.  I could not get them to cross the barrier of that which is my door to the outside world.  If I tried to carry them out, they would claw at me in a fury in order to get down and back inside.  All completely warrantless.  So getting them to the vet was a pain. After I felt my annual vet check ups weren't worth my vet subscription I cancelled it.  I couldn't stand hearing to distress my cats like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to four exact years later, 2019.  My girlfriend (we got together just a couple months after I got the cats) and I are watching Game of Thrones.  The first night, my complete fault.  I'd put off changing their litter box.  The cats pissed all over the couch we were on.  So I cleaned everything up, gave their box a deep cleaning, everything is square.   I'm Johnny on the spot with their box from here out.

&amp;#x200B;

Every week it continues.  My girlfriend already hates my cats.  She's hated them for a long time.  By the way, i just want to add, they never showed any signs of being territorial until about 2 years into my relationship when we introduced a third cat to foster for a friend of my girlfriend's.  

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend never gave me an ultimatum.  She never told me to get rid of my cats.  But I knew it's what she wanted.  She'd already expressed her contempt towards the cats with me plenty of times.  So when GoT finished, and my couches soiled, I knew what I had to do.  I called the humane society.  

&amp;#x200B;

It broke my heart. I dont even want to describe the process I had to go through getting them kennelled up.  If I could remember the worse trauma theyd been through before trying to go to the vet, this was 10 times worse.  It took me a full hour to grab them both.  By the end of it they were panting, scared, yelping, crying, extreme distress.  I was bawling my eyes out.

&amp;#x200B;

 These cats were like my babies.  They were young, angsty, weirdo cats, but they were special.  I dont really think they'll be picked up by a family that want to deal with them.  I cant even imagine what my cats are going through.  I signed up for what I believe is receiving a notice of them being rehomed, and it's been a month and I havent heard anything.  All I can hear in my hear is the girl cat crying.  The only thing that gives me any solace, is that if I haven't been notified at all yet, at least they should still have each other","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s rewind to spring 2015.

Today he noticed I got a haircut from yesterday that I didn’t think was that noticeable. It was just a trim. But the fact he noticed that little thing about me made me happy.

I usually see him a lot but today I didn’t and I think that’s why I’m feeling this way right now.
