It was my daughter's turn to go, so she did, when of course the dumbass kid before her decided to try to climb back up on the slide part. My daughter didn't see this until she came around the last turn in the slide, screamed, and then put her feet up to protect herself.

Her feet went into his chest, little kid falls backwards but manages to get a little bit of air because of the angle of the slide. Looked freaking awesome, straight out of a movie.

Kid's not even hurt, he just looked angry. Kid's mom was angry too, didn't say anything but kept glaring at me. I just turned to my daughter and very loudly said ""see, that's why we don't climb on the slide."" Kid's mom scoffed, another parent behind me chuckled. Then we left, the end.

EDIT: This blew up way bigger than I thought it would. Thanks everyone for participating in the discussion below on responsible parenting. I would like to clarify a couple of things though as they have come up in the comments:

1) I said in my post that the kid wasn't hurt. Obviously if the kid was hurt, we would've gone over to check on him and assist. Even if the mom just wasn't glaring at me, I probably still would've still walked over to talk. It was the fact that she just quietly glared at me from across the park is what inspired me to respond in my own passive aggressive fashion.

2) It was very obvious that my daughter put her feet up to protect herself, she only just turned 3. I am 100% certain that she was not intentionally trying to kick him.

3) It was a curly slide where you can't see the bottom from the top. There was a bigger kid standing at the bottom signalling the kids when it was safe for them to go... Big kid said go, my daughter went, but then the boy in front of her started climbing back up. Everyone yelled at the boy to get out of the way and he had ample time if he was listening.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were at the park, kids were taking turns going down the big, curly slide.

Ive never talked to anyone about this, even my wife doesnt know the full extent of it.. but here we go... 

In 2000 my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. She was a 2 pack a day smoker for about 25 years. She fought hard and was able to extend the short life expectantcy the doctors gave her. Im not sure how long they gave her, I was 10, they spared me the details. Anyways, she survived for over a year and ended up passing away in feb. of 2001. I remember as if it was yesterday, her best friend came over the very next day as we were in mourning to pay respects and say goodbye to her friend, which is normal and fine. The thing i felt weird about was that same night, the day after my mothers passing.. she spent the night with me and my dad. She slept on the couch. At the time i didnt think too much of it. Had other things on my mind, obviously. Plus we had numerous family and friends coming by and sleeping over before her passing as well, so i grew semi used to it.

Time goes by and it seems every other night shes sleeping over. Within the first month of my mothers death shes finally sleeping in my dads room with him. During this time she was respectful and nice. She brought her two youngest kids a lot as well, which was nice at the time. Fast forward 3 months, we ended up moving and she and her 2 kids end up coming with us. By this time they are already talking about marriage. Which i stongly protested, along with EVERY SINGLE FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE as well. They decide to ignore me, and everyone else, and get married.... The same year my mother passed away. At first things were the same as they were, but as time went on she began to show favoritism to her own kids. Which i guess is understandable? But to the extent that it grew was kind of disturbing. She'd let her kids get away with murder. They would taunt me, make fun of my dead mom. Threw ashtrays at me yelling ""your mom wants a hug"" (She was cremated, so pretty much anything with ash was fair game to use to fuck with me)

A year goes by in the new house and me being a skater kid, I frequented the skatepark alot. On my way back home one day, i ate shit. BAD. Hit a crack in the road on a very steep and large hill. I was probably going in excess of 20mph. The board stopped, my body flew, then rolled a few more feet. I was barely able to move but managed to hobble back, cradling my arm like a baby and screaming at the tops of my lungs the entire way home. As im walking up she intercepts me in the garage and accuses me of overreacting and tell me to quote ""stop being a little pussy."" I knew there was something wrong with my arm, considering i was physically unable to move it at all. But she wouldnt listen to me and my dad wasnt home from work yet either.  For hours i waited for him to show up and when he does, it turned out my SM had already talked to him. So he wouldnt listen either. The next day was a school day. I remember this because i was awoken by my SM's little cretin of a son throwing my full backpack onto my chest to wake me up. I woke up screaming. SM comes running to the room and promptly tells me to ""shut the fuck up, youre not hurt. Stop faking cause youre still going to school."" Well... i couldnt stop. I was in agony. I was still holding my arm like a baby, so she punched my bicep (in the fashion friends would i guess you could say) and said ""Im taking your dumb ass to the hospital just to make you feel stupid when they tell you nothing is wrong!"". Well upon seeing the doctor, he almost immedietly says ""Yup, your shoulder is broken. I can tell by the way your instinctively supporting your arm."" SM was silent. Doctor set up xrays, turns out my color bone was completely shattered. Proved her ass wrong, but it only fueled her rage more it seemed. She became spiteful. Took away all my skateboards, bikes, anything that i could ride. My arm was in a sling anyways so wasnt like i could use them anyways. But she had no intent on giving them back to me. Infact she gave them to her own son. Even my own dad said it was for the best because ""ive shown to be irresponsible with them. And cant use them correctly."" Only thing i was able to do was play video games. Barely. Considering my arm was completely bundled up. 

Another few months go by and my arm is healing up good, and we all go on an easy hike in the desert. We find and pick some wild cactus apples. Excited and eager, i start eating one with the help of my dad. Turns out there were little mites in the fruit, and i contracted scabies. Half of my face swells up in the most morbid of ways. Couldnt talk right, couldnt open one of my eyes. I was fucked up. My older sister (that i just realized I havent mentioned at all yet in this post) came to visit me with my 2 nephews. Drove 3 hours just to hang out with me and see how im doing. As soon as she sees my gruesome swollen facen she screams in terror, grabs her kids and leaves. Needless to say it made me feel like more shit, but i understand. She calls my dad, urging him to take me to the hospital. But SM again, refuses. Saying its not that bad and that all I need is a nice warm wash cloth. Well.. 2 weeks go by. Swelling is reduced, but not completely gone. Sister threatens to call the cops if they dont do something. So step mom AGAIN trys saying ""shes gonna feel dumb when it turns out to be nothing!"" Well... this time doctors say at this point  they cant tell what it is. (Scabies was the most likely considering the symptoms im told) That I should have been there 2 weeks prior when i couldnt open my eye. SM takes this as a win. 

More time goes by. More shit happens with SM. CPS is called and im interviewed. Nothing happens with that. Holidays were ruined by her kids, yet I was to blame. I ended up basically being the Cinderella of my house at this point. My bed was even moved into the laundry room. One year the piped burst and my room flooded up to 8 inches. Nothing was done about it. Eventually when i was about 14 years old, i worked up the courage to tell my dad what i thought about her. And how she treats me. Well, i guess by this time, he was so tainted by her that he began talking like her. He said to ""Get over it. Shes not mean. Youre just trying to antogonize for the sake of drama!"" I told him if thats how he feels, then im moving out to live with my sister. Sister agrees and I move out. Life was good for a bit. Till i started missing my dad. I felt like i failed him. So after 2 years living with my sister, i decided to move back in with my dad. Almost on arrival, SM starts her shit all over again. Comments like ""Great, more uneeded doctor visits."" Or ""No skateboarding, dont want your sister calling the CPS again."" (It was actually my aunt that called, i found out years later) 

On the day before my 17th birthday, i will never forget the words that came out of her mouth. I was getting breakfast and made a comment on how the house was starting to reak with cigarette smoke. Ill admit at this point i was a bit snarky. But i said it to myself. SM wasnt in the room, but she heard me alright. She storms in and tells me ""if you dont like it to go back to your sisters house. Or did she kick your whiney ass out and thats why youre back?"" I snapped, I told her to fuck off and to kill herself. She walked up to me and looked down at me (shes a good foot taller than i am. Im pretty damn short)  and says ""You do it. I fucking dare you."" I stare at her in disbelief   and she starts laughing. ""Fucking pussy. Youre weak. Just like your mom."" At this point I have a death grip on my fork, with every intention of sticking it in her throat.. But i dont. I keep quiet and continue eating my breakfast. That was the first of many comments about my mom. Seems she took a page from her own kids that used to say very similar insults. Only thing is... she was supposedly my moms ""best friend"".. i call her out on this and she tells me to fuck off and die. 

Because of the years of mental abuse, i become depressed. Suicide was on my mind a lot. And she knew it. She egged me on a lot. Telling me to say hi to my mom in hell when i get there. She would get drunk and say the most horrible things, like ""i  hope satan makes your mom put cigarette butts out on your face for eternity."" After a while of this.. i made a noose, measured the rope, and tied it to a wooden beam on my ceiling. One night, I hung myself. The wooden beam broke, and obviously i survived. I took this as a sign that maybe.. im not the one that needs to die. 

Eventually, I end up finding my Dads gun after a few days of snooping in his room when no one was home. I hid it in my room and kept telling myself on repeat ""Next time shes blind drunk."" 
Well.. a friend came over one night and we began talking a bit. I told him i was fed up and that i had a plan. I didnt go into details, but hes a smart person. He was able to figure out what i was planning pretty easily. He began crying to me. He plead for me not to go thru with anything and to move back into my sisters house. This went on for a quite a bit, but eventually he talked me out of it. I showed him the gun and he snatched it so fast and took off out of my house and down the road to the lake. He tossed that motherfucker as hard as he could in to the water. Somehow seeing that made me feel better. 

Anyways. I realize this is pretty anticlimactic, but after that I just ended up moving back in with my sister. No one in the family has any contact with my dad or his wife any more and at this point, i think thats his choice. Its been over 10 years since then. Ive moved across the country to numerous different states, ive made a career and name for myself. I got married to my dream girl and we have the best little girl together. Things could not be better. Last i heard, SM's two youngest are in rehab centers, and SM had a massive heart attack that almost killed her. Surprised me that she even has a heart, karma im guessing? Anyways.. thats my life.. Laid out in all its poorly written glory. Im sure some people wont buy this, but i honestly didnt put this here for anyone else other than myself. So its no skin off my back. Take what you want from this whole thing as you will. Im just glad to get this off my chest one way or another, and greatful that I had an amazing friend that was able to help me out my darkest of places.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty hard for me to post.

&lt;p&gt;In 2000 my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. She was a 2 pack a day smoker for about 25 years. She fought hard and was able to extend the short life expectantcy the doctors gave her. Im not sure how long they gave her, I was 10, they spared me the details. Anyways, she survived for over a year and ended up passing away in feb. of 2001. I remember as if it was yesterday, her best friend came over the very next day as we were in mourning to pay respects and say goodbye to her friend, which is normal and fine. The thing i felt weird about was that same night, the day after my mothers passing.. she spent the night with me and my dad. She slept on the couch. At the time i didnt think too much of it. Had other things on my mind, obviously. Plus we had numerous family and friends coming by and sleeping over before her passing as well, so i grew semi used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time goes by and it seems every other night shes sleeping over. Within the first month of my mothers death shes finally sleeping in my dads room with him. During this time she was respectful and nice. She brought her two youngest kids a lot as well, which was nice at the time. Fast forward 3 months, we ended up moving and she and her 2 kids end up coming with us. By this time they are already talking about marriage. Which i stongly protested, along with EVERY SINGLE FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE as well. They decide to ignore me, and everyone else, and get married.... The same year my mother passed away. At first things were the same as they were, but as time went on she began to show favoritism to her own kids. Which i guess is understandable? But to the extent that it grew was kind of disturbing. She&amp;#39;d let her kids get away with murder. They would taunt me, make fun of my dead mom. Threw ashtrays at me yelling &amp;quot;your mom wants a hug&amp;quot; (She was cremated, so pretty much anything with ash was fair game to use to fuck with me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year goes by in the new house and me being a skater kid, I frequented the skatepark alot. On my way back home one day, i ate shit. BAD. Hit a crack in the road on a very steep and large hill. I was probably going in excess of 20mph. The board stopped, my body flew, then rolled a few more feet. I was barely able to move but managed to hobble back, cradling my arm like a baby and screaming at the tops of my lungs the entire way home. As im walking up she intercepts me in the garage and accuses me of overreacting and tell me to quote &amp;quot;stop being a little pussy.&amp;quot; I knew there was something wrong with my arm, considering i was physically unable to move it at all. But she wouldnt listen to me and my dad wasnt home from work yet either.  For hours i waited for him to show up and when he does, it turned out my SM had already talked to him. So he wouldnt listen either. The next day was a school day. I remember this because i was awoken by my SM&amp;#39;s little cretin of a son throwing my full backpack onto my chest to wake me up. I woke up screaming. SM comes running to the room and promptly tells me to &amp;quot;shut the fuck up, youre not hurt. Stop faking cause youre still going to school.&amp;quot; Well... i couldnt stop. I was in agony. I was still holding my arm like a baby, so she punched my bicep (in the fashion friends would i guess you could say) and said &amp;quot;Im taking your dumb ass to the hospital just to make you feel stupid when they tell you nothing is wrong!&amp;quot;. Well upon seeing the doctor, he almost immedietly says &amp;quot;Yup, your shoulder is broken. I can tell by the way your instinctively supporting your arm.&amp;quot; SM was silent. Doctor set up xrays, turns out my color bone was completely shattered. Proved her ass wrong, but it only fueled her rage more it seemed. She became spiteful. Took away all my skateboards, bikes, anything that i could ride. My arm was in a sling anyways so wasnt like i could use them anyways. But she had no intent on giving them back to me. Infact she gave them to her own son. Even my own dad said it was for the best because &amp;quot;ive shown to be irresponsible with them. And cant use them correctly.&amp;quot; Only thing i was able to do was play video games. Barely. Considering my arm was completely bundled up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another few months go by and my arm is healing up good, and we all go on an easy hike in the desert. We find and pick some wild cactus apples. Excited and eager, i start eating one with the help of my dad. Turns out there were little mites in the fruit, and i contracted scabies. Half of my face swells up in the most morbid of ways. Couldnt talk right, couldnt open one of my eyes. I was fucked up. My older sister (that i just realized I havent mentioned at all yet in this post) came to visit me with my 2 nephews. Drove 3 hours just to hang out with me and see how im doing. As soon as she sees my gruesome swollen facen she screams in terror, grabs her kids and leaves. Needless to say it made me feel like more shit, but i understand. She calls my dad, urging him to take me to the hospital. But SM again, refuses. Saying its not that bad and that all I need is a nice warm wash cloth. Well.. 2 weeks go by. Swelling is reduced, but not completely gone. Sister threatens to call the cops if they dont do something. So step mom AGAIN trys saying &amp;quot;shes gonna feel dumb when it turns out to be nothing!&amp;quot; Well... this time doctors say at this point  they cant tell what it is. (Scabies was the most likely considering the symptoms im told) That I should have been there 2 weeks prior when i couldnt open my eye. SM takes this as a win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time goes by. More shit happens with SM. CPS is called and im interviewed. Nothing happens with that. Holidays were ruined by her kids, yet I was to blame. I ended up basically being the Cinderella of my house at this point. My bed was even moved into the laundry room. One year the piped burst and my room flooded up to 8 inches. Nothing was done about it. Eventually when i was about 14 years old, i worked up the courage to tell my dad what i thought about her. And how she treats me. Well, i guess by this time, he was so tainted by her that he began talking like her. He said to &amp;quot;Get over it. Shes not mean. Youre just trying to antogonize for the sake of drama!&amp;quot; I told him if thats how he feels, then im moving out to live with my sister. Sister agrees and I move out. Life was good for a bit. Till i started missing my dad. I felt like i failed him. So after 2 years living with my sister, i decided to move back in with my dad. Almost on arrival, SM starts her shit all over again. Comments like &amp;quot;Great, more uneeded doctor visits.&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;No skateboarding, dont want your sister calling the CPS again.&amp;quot; (It was actually my aunt that called, i found out years later) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day before my 17th birthday, i will never forget the words that came out of her mouth. I was getting breakfast and made a comment on how the house was starting to reak with cigarette smoke. Ill admit at this point i was a bit snarky. But i said it to myself. SM wasnt in the room, but she heard me alright. She storms in and tells me &amp;quot;if you dont like it to go back to your sisters house. Or did she kick your whiney ass out and thats why youre back?&amp;quot; I snapped, I told her to fuck off and to kill herself. She walked up to me and looked down at me (shes a good foot taller than i am. Im pretty damn short)  and says &amp;quot;You do it. I fucking dare you.&amp;quot; I stare at her in disbelief   and she starts laughing. &amp;quot;Fucking pussy. Youre weak. Just like your mom.&amp;quot; At this point I have a death grip on my fork, with every intention of sticking it in her throat.. But i dont. I keep quiet and continue eating my breakfast. That was the first of many comments about my mom. Seems she took a page from her own kids that used to say very similar insults. Only thing is... she was supposedly my moms &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot;.. i call her out on this and she tells me to fuck off and die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the years of mental abuse, i become depressed. Suicide was on my mind a lot. And she knew it. She egged me on a lot. Telling me to say hi to my mom in hell when i get there. She would get drunk and say the most horrible things, like &amp;quot;i  hope satan makes your mom put cigarette butts out on your face for eternity.&amp;quot; After a while of this.. i made a noose, measured the rope, and tied it to a wooden beam on my ceiling. One night, I hung myself. The wooden beam broke, and obviously i survived. I took this as a sign that maybe.. im not the one that needs to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I end up finding my Dads gun after a few days of snooping in his room when no one was home. I hid it in my room and kept telling myself on repeat &amp;quot;Next time shes blind drunk.&amp;quot; 
Well.. a friend came over one night and we began talking a bit. I told him i was fed up and that i had a plan. I didnt go into details, but hes a smart person. He was able to figure out what i was planning pretty easily. He began crying to me. He plead for me not to go thru with anything and to move back into my sisters house. This went on for a quite a bit, but eventually he talked me out of it. I showed him the gun and he snatched it so fast and took off out of my house and down the road to the lake. He tossed that motherfucker as hard as he could in to the water. Somehow seeing that made me feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways. I realize this is pretty anticlimactic, but after that I just ended up moving back in with my sister. No one in the family has any contact with my dad or his wife any more and at this point, i think thats his choice. Its been over 10 years since then. Ive moved across the country to numerous different states, ive made a career and name for myself. I got married to my dream girl and we have the best little girl together. Things could not be better. Last i heard, SM&amp;#39;s two youngest are in rehab centers, and SM had a massive heart attack that almost killed her. Surprised me that she even has a heart, karma im guessing? Anyways.. thats my life.. Laid out in all its poorly written glory. Im sure some people wont buy this, but i honestly didnt put this here for anyone else other than myself. So its no skin off my back. Take what you want from this whole thing as you will. Im just glad to get this off my chest one way or another, and greatful that I had an amazing friend that was able to help me out my darkest of places.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Since the start of 2008, I was being molested in class by an extremely horny male classmate. I kept quiet as I thought it’d do more harm if everyone else knew about it. As a 12 year old, I thought I did the right thing. But I was wrong. He continued touching me inappropriately, and my heart started racing when I was around him. My undeveloped brain thought I was attracted to him. He asked for nudes once, and I obliged. It turn very sexual from there on after he started blackmailing so I’ll just summarise - I was forced into a FWB relationship with him. He insisted sex on multiple occasions but I was afraid of getting pregnant. And for some reason, I was tasked to get some birth control else he’ll spread my nudes. 

A year later in 2009. There was a rumour in my school that a 26 year old guy named “James”, was randomly adding girls from my school on Facebook. He will PM them after girls accepted his friend request. We were warned to decline his request and block him as many of my friends were repulsed by his behaviour. Of course, I did not. I did the opposite. I accepted his friend request and started taking to him. The chat turned very sexual and he started hinting that he would like to meet up very soon. I agreed on one condition, that he would bring me condoms. I’ll pay for it of course. I thought I was smart by asking him to meet me in a crowded mall. But he was smarter, he told me he was smoking and told me to meet him at the alley behind the mall. 

It was a lose-lose situation for me. But I decided I’ll meet up with him anyway. He told me to give him a hug, and I did. He started touched me for about 10 mins and I felt nothing. He asked for a kiss on the lips and I did. He asked if he could touch me under the skirt and I said no. He grabbed my thigh under my skirt and grope me for a while more. He then passed me the condoms and I paid him $10. Nothing happened after that. He didn’t rape me. I thanked him and he walked to his car and drove off. I blocked him right after. 

I went back home and immediately took a long shower. Of all times, my mum decided to move my bag from the living area to my room. She saw the condoms and confiscated it. She was clearly disappointed, but I guess she was relieved as it was a new pack of condoms. I brushed it off as a prank by my friends and got away with it. I told my “fwb” what happened and he called me a liar as I could not produce picture proof of the condoms. I guess he did show the nudes to some of my classmates, but at least he didn’t send and spread them. Many of my female friends shunned me, and I could hear people calling me a slut. 4 guys approached me for free handjobs/blowjobs and I declined them all. 

I tolerated and was at my “fwb’s” service till I finally graduated. I guess I can’t be bothered anymore. I deactivated all my social media and went off the grid. I could not face anyone. 

And now looking back, I cannot help but feel like a complete idiot for allowing all of that to happen. My family doesn’t know of the bullying. They assumed I was just a quiet child. This is the first time I’m letting all my pent up feelings out and now I’m here crying over all my past mistakes. My grades suffered badly and I’m struggling in university.

In High School my family was moving - I came to a new school for junior year. My Father was a really popular teacher at the time - was considered the “cool” teacher. All his students loved his class to the point where parents would contact the school’s administration and request to have their kids in his class.

I was in a new school, didnt really have too many friends - felt pretty down on myself. One day a girl came up to me and struck up an awesome conversation. We instantly hit it off. Loved the same movies, music, sports - I was almost instantly in love with her.

She friendzoned me, but I honestly didnt mind because we got along so well.

Fast forward a few years - we are best friends. Spend most days and weekends together - I have complete trust in her. There isn’t anything we do without the other (including a new physical benefit to our friendship).

I call her house after school one day, and her mom answers - she asks me not to call anymore and they will see me in court.

I reach out to her family and friends - no one knows what is up. She dropped out of school, went completely ghost mode on everyone. All in the span of a week.

A few months later I get a call from her - she was at a local psychiatric facility, she had attempted to kill herself. When I asked why she stated it was because her “boyfriend” was in love with someone else. This surprised me, had no clue she even liked anyone - we spent so much time together and it was never brought up. I asked who he was and how long it was going on an someone on the other end told her to hang up the phone.

That day I told my parents, and with complete sadness in their voice they told me what they had been informed by police.

She had tried to kill herself and was committed after she demanded my father leave my mother to be with her. She was my Dad’s former student (which I knew) and apparently had emailed him about sports teams and news frequently. My Dad responded because why wouldnt he? Jawing about prospects, trades and other random things seemed harmless. At some point she began to stir the conversation in strange ways and my father stopped responding (which is a stupid way to handle it as she was at our house multiple times a week - would have been nice to know).

Some of the things that did come out of the case were the findings that she had planned to befriend me to get to my Dad, and shared that plan with some of her friends (whom at this point I had known and hung out with on many occasions).

It was a complete conspiracy - I was a puppet and afterwards, all I wanted was to have her in my life somehow.

I should hate her and despise her. I shouldnt ever think about her again, but the only two times in my life I have seen her since this all happened, the only thing crossing my mind was I missed her, and loved her.

Some people in my life know about this situation - no one knows that I didnt hate her. It took her becoming a staunch anti-vaxx and flat earth supporter for me to finally snap out of it and realize how crazy she was.

I feel like a fucking idiot.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a few short comings in my life, but this one is really hard to articulate, so naturally - I figured I would start with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In High School my family was moving - I came to a new school for junior year. My Father was a really popular teacher at the time - was considered the “cool” teacher. All his students loved his class to the point where parents would contact the school’s administration and request to have their kids in his class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a new school, didnt really have too many friends - felt pretty down on myself. One day a girl came up to me and struck up an awesome conversation. We instantly hit it off. Loved the same movies, music, sports - I was almost instantly in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She friendzoned me, but I honestly didnt mind because we got along so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years - we are best friends. Spend most days and weekends together - I have complete trust in her. There isn’t anything we do without the other (including a new physical benefit to our friendship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call her house after school one day, and her mom answers - she asks me not to call anymore and they will see me in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reach out to her family and friends - no one knows what is up. She dropped out of school, went completely ghost mode on everyone. All in the span of a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later I get a call from her - she was at a local psychiatric facility, she had attempted to kill herself. When I asked why she stated it was because her “boyfriend” was in love with someone else. This surprised me, had no clue she even liked anyone - we spent so much time together and it was never brought up. I asked who he was and how long it was going on an someone on the other end told her to hang up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That day I told my parents, and with complete sadness in their voice they told me what they had been informed by police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had tried to kill herself and was committed after she demanded my father leave my mother to be with her. She was my Dad’s former student (which I knew) and apparently had emailed him about sports teams and news frequently. My Dad responded because why wouldnt he? Jawing about prospects, trades and other random things seemed harmless. At some point she began to stir the conversation in strange ways and my father stopped responding (which is a stupid way to handle it as she was at our house multiple times a week - would have been nice to know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The families went to court. She failed to appear or produce any of the evidence she claimed she had. Her descriptions of emails and messages that were “sexual” in nature - were reviewed by the judge and found to contain no such content.

So I have a little sibling I used to babysit sometimes, I was forced to watch Barney , that damned purple dinosaur, ALL THE TIME, I get it, he was the golden child, big deal.

I worked hard to buy gifts for me especially birthday presents, I used to congratulate myself when I finally done something right, while my parents cared more for their favourite children, I was there for myself.

So this little shi- ...sibling broke my precious possessions ( nice vases, mini status, CDs ..etc) and cut my favorite book because the cover was "" cool "", I told my parents, they did nothing because he is their little angel, I forgave him many times but one day he "" accidentally "" throw my phone in the water.

I lost it my sanity, so I locked him in a room, and took his big Barney toy, his favorite birthday present from mommy dearest , started playing opera in the background, then I crucified Barney, stabbed him few times in his green belly, let him swallow the mud to make his idiotic smile vanish, poured some gasoline on him and burned the MF slowly to the ground, he should have never survived the meteor billions of years ago . 


(NOTE: I WAS CAREFUL) so everything was fine except for my little shitbling who saw everything from the window.

&lt;p&gt;I essentially voted for the party my mother was annoying me about because it was almost certain that that party would win and I voted it because of one thing. The educational system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The educational system in Greece is absolutely shit and it changes literally every six months. And now I’m going to give finals and go to the university so instability in the educational system is the last thing I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know if the new system is going to be good but at this point I don’t care, I just want it to be stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like that party at all it doesn’t represent me on any level and I only voted it because I don’t want instability in the educational system because its my  last and most critical year as my future will be decided by it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I essentially fell bad about is that I violated my most basic belief about the right to vote just because my mother was bitching about the elections 24/7&lt;/p&gt;

I could go on and on about my issues with my brother. To sum it up in my opinion, I hate him and I think he is a trashy person. But for this post I am just going to specify the reasons why I don't believe his ""confession"" to his schools counselor.

1. He does absolutely nothing productive as a fellow member of our household.

He does have chores, but doesnt do them. If he is forced to do it he will do it wrong on purpose so either I go after him and fix it, or I tell him that he is doing it wrong so he can fix it, my mom gets mad at me for ""harassing"" him and she just makes me do it instead. So in the end I always do it. He knows this pattern and purposefully does everything wrong so I will have to do it.
Other than chores, all he does is sit in his room and watch youtube videos. He doesn't help make dinner. He doesn't clean up after himself when he makes a mess. (counting flushing the toilet and wiping up his own vomit) He doesn't do anything unless my mom is in the room forcing him to do it.

2. He is an attention whore. 

When he isn't messing around on his excessive amount of electronics he is doing everything under the sun to get some attention. Most of it is negative since I don't like being around him (or my whole family for that matter) and try to distance myself. He will take stuff from my room do I have to chase him down. He goes and plays unwanted 21 questions with my mom while she is on the phone or doing work. And when we are sharing stories about stuff we read that day or experienced at work or school he will take the same exact story and retell it with different names. (not really that bad but it irks the hell outta me.) In public if the attention is focused on someone else he will throw what I call a tantrum. Which is forcing tears our of his eyes, while ignoring everyone's questions about what is wrong, walking away and leaving for minutes at a time, and standing in place and refusing to move when we need to leave. 


3. He is a compulsive liar.

He will lie about anything and everything. Even if you have the clear evidence of him committing the act right in front of him he will still deny. He lies about doing his school work, cleaning his room, eating in his room. (he literally had wrappers and crumbs under his pillow and still claimed he didn't do it.) He thinks that it is all a joke and will laugh everytime I tell him that lying is bad.

Here's a good kicker if you thought I was just an asshole sibling. 

4. He has lied to the school's counselors before. 

A few years ago he told that counselor that he was getting beat at home. CPS was called, investigation was held, nothing found. I used to get whooped as a child with a belt. I'd actually say it did me some good because my mom has never laid anything on my brother. The worst that is happened to him is that his hands got slapped  for stealing.

Of course I post this one here because if I ever were to express a bad opinion about my mother's ""sweet little baby"" all hell would break loose.

I do not actually know full what he told the counselor, my mom told me the title and just warned to be on look out. I did use to harass him a lot about chores when he wouldnt do them, but I stopped since finding this out cause my mom was on my ass 24/7.

My brother is 14 years old going into high school. I really believe that this is all one big lie for him so he can get some attention and get out of his responsibilies.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile warning blah blah, also I just have issues writing down my thoughts so it might be a bit confusing to understand my ranting. &lt;/p&gt;

Also, sorry for length, formatting and writing.

To give some context, I've always been mentally unstable, depressed most notably. It's likely more of a genetic thing than something learned, as its always been a fact in my life. It could be traced all the way back to when I was 12, but it's hard to tell for me really. 

If I was a time bomb before puberty, I was a fucking melting down reactor in my teens. All the new hormones and moving into highschool along with other things I don't want to get into was rough really. I was a mess, but I never really had any breakdowns. Instead what I did to cope most of the time was cut and plan my suicide. It got so bad that I was sometimes give myself up to 20 cuts a day and went through only-god-knows how many drafts of my final goodbyes. As I said, I was never very stable. 

To make matters worse, my mother was also in a lot of stress and pain at the time, much more than I could really imagine really. She has a family history of breast cancer and always got checked yearly. That particular year they found the devil peeking out of her left breast. Luckily, it was still pre-cancerous, but my mother decided to get both of her breasts removed just to free herself of the continuous worry of finding one that could kill her. She always looked so youthful, but then her true age showed. When she came home after her surgery, she was shaking, frail and almost seemed to still be in shock, all while still having my baby brother peek up on her shoulders. Even with all of the medications, it was easy to tell that most of what she felt at the time was pain. While she was sure to recover, it didn't make it any easier.

The incident in question, the source of much grief and anger, came on a bright and sunny Friday on March 4th while I was nearing the end of 9th grade. I honestly don't know what got into me that day, but that day I was just so bratty. I wanted to stay outside, to be able to avoid the sight of my mother in pain and the realization that I, the unstable retard, had to be one of the responsible obes, looking after a boy who's life I could ruin before it started. But who am I kidding, Im just making excuses for myself. I tried to stay outside and just stay out, but my parents said that it was too dangerous and that I should just come inside. Of course I complied, but also made my mistake. When I entered into the house, I gave my dad a terse ""Hi Im home"" and locked myself into my room. In further hindsight, I think he said something to me before I went into my room, but I didn't hear it. Maybe if I had just slowed down and listened more carefully, none of that would have happened. Maybe. Probably. 

Not even 5 minutes later, I heard banging on my door. Despite my attitude, Im a coward and was terrified of opening the door, hearing my mother scream for me to open it. The moment I did, I was meet with a look of anger that still makes me squirm now really. She pushed me into the corner of my room, screaming at me, asking me who gave me permission to lock my door and how dare I show such disrespect to my own father. She never laid a finger on me before and the push didn't even hurt, but after repressing emotions all my life, that just broke me and lead to me having the first breakdown in my life right in front of my own mother. I remember it all so vividly: how I chocked on my own snot and tears, how I practically screeched any answer I thought would calm her down, how it felt to have her stand over me and continue to yell about doors and respect and how it felt literally groveling in a ball in front of my own mother like a fucking worm. It's all so embarrassing to think about now, but its part of confessing really. 

I also remember the aftermath clearly, how she said I wasn't allowed to lock my doors anymore and how I need to be respectful before leaving me on the ground for 10 minutes. Eventually, I got up and apologized to my dad and said goodbye to them as they left for the pharmacy. I also remember frantically pulling up my suicide note and trying to find the gun my dad recently bought for self-defense. Honestly, I still sometimes think that me surviving that day was a fluke, as if the gun weren't in the car, I could have perfectly been able to go into the nearby forest and shoot myself in its heart, like I imagined so many times before. Instead, I was just stuck running through all of the other options before just deciding to cut myself again. 

I resented and despised my mother for years after that incident and blamed her for my suicide ""attempt"", if you could even call it that. I resented her for yelling and pushing me when I was so stressed and I resented her for ""pretending to care"" and couldn't accept her love. Most of all, I resented her for never apologizing to me. 

But I realize now that none of it was really her fault. She never knew about the stress, the cutting and all of my other issues because I never told her. She didn't even know until I was in the 11th grade, a little over a year that I stopped cutting. I also know that Im the one that takes her words roo close to heart. When normal kids get yelled at by their mothers, they get angry, sad, shame and only feel a little bad. When I get yelled at by my mother, I immediately resort to punishing myself through cutting. She didn't even do anything to start it in the first place; I just put her on too high of a pedestal. 

In the end, after years of pointing fingers I realize that I could only justly point the finger at myself. While I still feel a little bit angry at my mother, I feel better with her now knowing that it wasn't her that ruined my life, but myself. Its a lot less tiring and just correct; I don't really know how to explain it really.

At first grade, our class had some kind of competition, that whoever had the most blu-tack would like be the king of the game.

So right before playtime was over, I sneaked to class and ate A LOT of blu-tack. Unfortunately I did nit stretch any more than usual so I just went back outside. Then when the whole class went back inside and someone shouted ""All my blu-tack is gone!"" and a lot of other people had lost theirs too. 

It was sad. People were devastated. I was scared because i thought that I would get caught. Lucky for me, Ashley had a tummy ache right that day and I started telling my friends that I saw Ashley eating the blu-tack. 

Then all the kids went to tell the teacher that Ashley ate the blu-tack and the teacher had a conversation with Ashley about how you can't take other people's stuff.

So, I have a friend, he's a 16-year-old trans dude with undiagnosed personality issues. He genuinely believes he's fictional characters. Like, I get people like to kin and rp and stuff but he, GENUINELY BELIEVES different cartoons and animes are starring him. His most recent kin-shift is Deku from My Hero Academia, and is doing his best to act like him, even going as far as expressing that he wants to hurt himself so that his scars match the show. He goes on rants about how he loves and misses ""Kacchan"" and thinks he's dating this cartoon dude. I've tried asking him who he's actually dating. Who The Real Him is actually dating, but he just says its no-one.

Now don't get me wrong, I can put up with the whole kin thing, (excluding the desire to self harm) but now he's starting to let this shit effect his day to day life. He's said he doesn't want to get a license because ""I never drive in my show"" and he insists that he's a baby. 

But there's also something going on with him. The real him. He keeps talking about wanting to die and wanting to go to Kacchan. I've approached him on this multiple times in multiple different ways. I've asked if his meds are working alright. He said yes, they're working perfectly. I've asked if he needs to unload and just rant to me. He said no, there's nothing too important to talk about. I've asked if he's still seeing a therapist, he's said yes, he goes once a week and treatment has been working great. But in the tags and comments of every little Instagram post, he makes he goes on a multi-paragraph string of garbled words about how he's scared and how no one likes him and how he'd be better off dead. 

I've brought this up to him many times and every time he says he'll get better. And every time I push just a little more than necessary about how much I love him and how I'm open for anything at any time. I tell him he's like a little brother to me. How I wouldn't be as mentally stable in life as I am right now if he were never here to help me through it all. 

I'm tired of him pushing me away all the time. I'd give anything to help him but he just won't fucking let me in. I'm thinking about cutting ties with him but I'm worried about what he might do without me there to check up on him every day.

He looses it, starts screaming the same accusations at the rest of the family, and says that he can stay here anymore because we are being so terrible to him and walks toward the door. My mistake: i told him that what he was saying wasn’t true instead of letting him leave. To be clear, i never lied or said I wanted him to stay or took back what I said. I just wanted to make sure everyone knew the truth and that my sister and I did nothing wrong. Needless to say, he did not leave and immediately starts using his almost-leaving against us.

On the other hand, I refuse to accept his abuse anymore and refuse to lie to make him feel better. For this reason, i really don’t care if he stays either. By stopping him from leaving I just perpetuated this impasse instead of letting it come to a natural conclusion. I have been the peacekeeper in my family for years, which only enables him to be out of control. I kept the rest of my family in this abusive cycle when the very abuser was, maybe, going to end it. I messed up. Now, I cant take it back nor can I address it with the rest of my family because I feel so guilty. I cant tell anyone because they will not believe me.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Back when I was 20 years old, I was in the army stationed overseas. There I met M, also in the army, and we hit it off well. We dated a few months, but we were both young and it didn’t work out. A month after we broke up, she informs me she is pregnant. Big shock, but we agree marriage is not a good idea. Our daughter is born, and I hire a lawyer to establish paternity and child support/visitation. 

For a couple years, things go well. M and I remain in the army, but get stationed far away from each other. M gets married, has a second daughter. Her husband is a decent guy, also in the army. He raises my daughter well, respects my visitation rights, no problems with him. I see my daughter when I can for vacations and take her to see my family on holidays. 

When my daughter is four, they get divorced, and M gets out of the army. She moves in with her parents on the east coast while she gets her life together, I’m stationed in the western US. Maybe sic months later, she suggests moving near me. We’re still on good terms, and realize I still have feelings for her, so I agree. 

I help M get set up with her own apartment, and new job. I’m living in my own one bedroom apartment as we’re not married, but I visit her often. Things go well for a few months, I help her with the kids, help her take care of her place, make sure she she has child care when she’s working, etc. 

Then... I find out she’s stealing from me. She stole my checkbook and wrote over $1000 in bad checks.  I break it off immediately. There’s no way I can trust her now.  I’ll be a father to my daughter, keep up paying child support, but I can’t stand being around M for any length of time. 

Over the next two months, her home life deteriorates badly. To the point where I’m seriously worried about the welfare of her kids. The apartment is never cleaned, trash is getting knee deep in places, her cats run wild and shit everywhere. My daughter tells me sometimes she gets left alone while mommy goes out with friends. I call CPS, they make a welfare visit, and immediately they take the kids out of the house. My daughter is placed with me pending a full custody hearing, and Ms ex husband is able to come and take custody of his daughter. M doesn’t fight for custody, and moves back with her parents. 

Three years pass. My daughter and I are doing pretty well. I’m a single dad in the army, stationed in the mid west. Mind you, this was in the 90s, before Iraq and Afghanistan, so the chances of me going to a combat zone are low. We haven’t heard from M at all after the court awards me full custody. I still talk to M’s ex husband, our daughters are sisters and they talk on the phone and send cards and pictures to each other. I learn from him that M has never been very stable, and that’s one of the things that led to their divorce. He has no contact with M either, but he’s heard from her parents that she’s gotten married again and has three kids. 

Then one day... I get a letter from DFS in M’s home state. She’s been sentenced to prison for check forgery and she’s claiming that I’m the father of her twin daughters. They want a DNA test, and if it’s positive they will go after me for child support. I’m stunned. But, long story short, it turns out I’m the father, and my lawyer makes a good case for no child support seeing as I’ve been raising our first daughter with no help from her for the last three years. The court agrees. The whole situation is a total shock to me, but my first priority is raising my daughter. 

I got out of the army not long after that. Met a very nice woman and got married, who loves being a mom. (No other children between us). I considered suing for visitation and possibly custody, but decided against it. I really didn’t want to get anywhere near M again, and didn’t want to put my daughter through that.  She had a lot of anger toward her mother already for feeling abandoned and for how she was treated before I got custody. 

The only people in my life who know are my daughter and my wife. My parents and brothers have no clue. For the last 17 years I have followed the twins online, and they appear to be doing well. When they turned 18 I reached out via Facebook, but got no response. I don’t blame them, it must be incredibly difficult when a parent you’ve never met appears out of nowhere.  That was two years ago.  My daughter is now 25 and recently married with a child of her own. She still talks to her half sister from M’s first husband, but as far as I know she’s never talked to M or the twins, and she prefers not to. She told me many times she doesn’t think of M as her mother, and while there is some curiosity about her she would rather not talk to her again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story, please bear with me.

Her husband is a decent guy, also in the army. He raises my daughter well, respects my visitation rights, no problems with him. I see my daughter when I can for vacations and take her to see my family on holidays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my daughter is four, they get divorced, and M gets out of the army. She moves in with her parents on the east coast while she gets her life together, I’m stationed in the western US. Maybe sic months later, she suggests moving near me. We’re still on good terms, and realize I still have feelings for her, so I agree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I help M get set up with her own apartment, and new job. I’m living in my own one bedroom apartment as we’re not married, but I visit her often. Things go well for a few months, I help her with the kids, help her take care of her place, make sure she she has child care when she’s working, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then... I find out she’s stealing from me. She stole my checkbook and wrote over $1000 in bad checks.  I break it off immediately. There’s no way I can trust her now.  I’ll be a father to my daughter, keep up paying child support, but I can’t stand being around M for any length of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months, her home life deteriorates badly. To the point where I’m seriously worried about the welfare of her kids. The apartment is never cleaned, trash is getting knee deep in places, her cats run wild and shit everywhere. My daughter tells me sometimes she gets left alone while mommy goes out with friends. I call CPS, they make a welfare visit, and immediately they take the kids out of the house. My daughter is placed with me pending a full custody hearing, and Ms ex husband is able to come and take custody of his daughter. M doesn’t fight for custody, and moves back with her parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years pass. My daughter and I are doing pretty well. I’m a single dad in the army, stationed in the mid west. Mind you, this was in the 90s, before Iraq and Afghanistan, so the chances of me going to a combat zone are low. We haven’t heard from M at all after the court awards me full custody. I still talk to M’s ex husband, our daughters are sisters and they talk on the phone and send cards and pictures to each other. I learn from him that M has never been very stable, and that’s one of the things that led to their divorce. He has no contact with M either, but he’s heard from her parents that she’s gotten married again and has three kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day... I get a letter from DFS in M’s home state. She’s been sentenced to prison for check forgery and she’s claiming that I’m the father of her twin daughters. They want a DNA test, and if it’s positive they will go after me for child support. I’m stunned. But, long story short, it turns out I’m the father, and my lawyer makes a good case for no child support seeing as I’ve been raising our first daughter with no help from her for the last three years. The court agrees. The whole situation is a total shock to me, but my first priority is raising my daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got out of the army not long after that. Met a very nice woman and got married, who loves being a mom. (No other children between us). I considered suing for visitation and possibly custody, but decided against it. I really didn’t want to get anywhere near M again, and didn’t want to put my daughter through that.  She had a lot of anger toward her mother already for feeling abandoned and for how she was treated before I got custody. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only people in my life who know are my daughter and my wife. My parents and brothers have no clue. For the last 17 years I have followed the twins online, and they appear to be doing well. When they turned 18 I reached out via Facebook, but got no response. I don’t blame them, it must be incredibly difficult when a parent you’ve never met appears out of nowhere.  That was two years ago.  My daughter is now 25 and recently married with a child of her own. She still talks to her half sister from M’s first husband, but as far as I know she’s never talked to M or the twins, and she prefers not to. She told me many times she doesn’t think of M as her mother, and while there is some curiosity about her she would rather not talk to her again.&lt;/p&gt;

So, This happened like 3 hours ago now. And I'm actually still kinda shaking. 

First, you should probably get a better understanding of my situation and how our grading system works.

Basically, You get a grade beteen 1,0 - 10,0 
ten being the best.

you need a 6 to pass, but it can also be a rounded up 5,5

Now, I was not taking this test under normal circumstances.

Earlier this year I had a mental breakdown, but because of that, I ended up missing about a month and a half of class. ( the breakdown was because of anxiety attacks) 

We have only 3 tests a year per subject and they're all cramped into one week. I ended up missing the entire second wave.

School was very supportive in helping me as they considered it pointless for me to redo the year. I got no softer passing conditions but they did let me take all of those tests I missed, about one a week.

This went fairly well, considering I was still recovering. And it looked like I was still going to pass. I even did pretty well on my third testweek 

Conditions to pass were a maximum of 2 failed subjects and those could at most be a 5 and a 4.
A 3 or three fives was not acceptable.

And you had to compensate those with 3 extra points. Example: 7, 7, 7 or 8, 7

I now have all my grades in except for 1 

And I have a 5, 5, 5 with three compensation points.

I could end up getting one more 5, for subject X
50% chance I'd say.

It would seem I can't pass anymore.
But I can, because after the second and third period you get to retake one test, so because I never got my second retake. I now have 2 left.

I'm probably going to choose
Subject A and C 

Which means I'll need to improve:
A 4,8 --&gt; 5,1+
C 2,0 --&gt; 2,4+
Seems easy enough ( ridiculously easy)
Then I'd have either one five or two ( in case I fail subject X) 

But that is after I've cheated. I cheated on subject C this morning. 

I'd calculated that I needed about a 2,1 to get a 4 average, average is now a 5.

If I hadn't cheated I would have gotten either a 4 or a 3. A 3 only if I scored below 2,1. Which is absolutely pathetic. So let's say a 4. 

In this case I would retake A and B requiring:
A 4,8 --&gt; 5,1+
B 2,6 --&gt;  5,7+
Very do-able

Then I'd score a 4, or in case I fail subject X a 4 and a 5. So I'd still pass.

Only difference is before cheating I'd need
A 4,8 --&gt; 5,1+
B 2,6 --&gt; 5,7+
C 2,1+ ( for the test I cheated on)

Now I need 
A 4,8 --&gt; 5,1+
C 2,0 --&gt; 2,4+ 

And I'd end up with either a 5 or two  fives ( subject X)  If I pass subject X, I'll only have to improve either A or C a tiny bit. 

So, I've made passing a bit easier, and my final score higher.

I feel like the 2,1 for C would have been incredibly easy, since I knew the subject well.

But the 5,7 for B would take a considerable amount of time. And since I have a lower chance there, I won't be retaking it. So my knowledge will remain at the 2,6. ( I had no idea what the test was even about) And now, I'll lack this material.

But now that you undertand my situation, onto the actual cheating.

So, I had to take this test which was still from the second period today, after my last third period test. 

There were other people taking missed tests but mine had gone missing, and by the time I got it, the rest had already finished.

So, I got my own classroom, without even a teacher there. ( I couldn't bring my books and there was no one else to talk with, so they thought it'd be fine.) 

I got one hour to finish it, and then they left me alone.

Now, I was aiming for that 2,1 which should be very do-able. I have literally never cheated and I still had no intention to.

But then, my honor was put to the test. I found out that with my test, came the answer key.

By accident they'd given me the entire 'test 2' file, both the questions for the students, and the answers for the teacher.

I was alone, would be for at least an hour, and I'd been given all the aswers. 

Now, this had happened before. But I was not alone and it was a subject I'd have aced regardless. So, I immediately told them they'd accidentally given me the answers.

This was different, I could 100% get away with it. And I hadn't yet received my other grades, so I didn't know the conseqences on my chance of passing the year.

I still wanted to turn it in, but then I thought to myself.

'What would any other teenage boy do in this situation?' 

They'd go to great lenghts to cheat, was I really going to turn this in?

I'd been dealt a pretty shitty hand this year, and because of stress, I got screwed even worse.

( I didn't know there was a last page on a test for a subject I usually ace, it was even the one exercise I was most confident in. I ended up with a 5,6 but needed a 5,9. That last page could have gotten me a 7,6 easily. Which is what I usually get

So, it would only be fair if I took advantage, right?

Sure, school has helped me. But I still needed to take the same amount of test in the same amount of time, third period was lots of stress, and I wasn't even fully recovered yet.

What if I fail this year because of this one test? What if this makes the difference?

I decided to go for it. Though I hadn't yet figured out how I would explain I had the answer key.

I ended up only answering the questions I understood, and could explain in my own words. The rest I left open.

I believe I could have answered those questions myself, and gotten the same score. But I might have been soft on myself, you always end up losing points to those questions you 'totally knew' 

I'd put the answer sheet under the questions so I could easily cover them up and pretend I didn't see them. I did this unnecessarily a few times, but  eventually the teacher actually did come in. Luckily I was fast enough.

I naively asked if my time was up already,( not even close, and I knew that )

He'd said he'd suddenly realized he might have accidentally given me the answers, so he went digging through my pile of papers.

I'd set things up perfectly, so it seemed like they were still just under my testpaper. 

I pretended to be surprised, even made a corny 'if only I had known earlier.' Joke 

He bought it, and just took them with him.
I'd already finished copying, so I didn't mind.

I sat out my time, and handed in the test.

I aced it 8,0 not ridiculous.

But my mom will definitely take notice, and I'll have to pretend to be happy with my grade.

I also made passing conditions easier, and will now lack knowledge on subject B. So, I might enter next year unprepeared.

I still feel bad, and I'm not sure what I should tell my mom. 

I also feel like I didn't really pass. And that I'm only fooling myself, so I'll eventually fall because I'm not really prepared.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so, I&amp;#39;m 17, a guy, not in the best place right now and this is mostly me rambling and stressing over cheating this one time, it will contain a lot of info.

Then I&amp;#39;d have either one five or two ( in case I fail subject X) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is after I&amp;#39;ve cheated. I cheated on subject C this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d calculated that I needed about a 2,1 to get a 4 average, average is now a 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I hadn&amp;#39;t cheated I would have gotten either a 4 or a 3. A 3 only if I scored below 2,1. Which is absolutely pathetic. So let&amp;#39;s say a 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case I would retake A and B requiring:
A 4,8 --&amp;gt; 5,1+
B 2,6 --&amp;gt;  5,7+
Very do-able&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;d score a 4, or in case I fail subject X a 4 and a 5. So I&amp;#39;d still pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only difference is before cheating I&amp;#39;d need
A 4,8 --&amp;gt; 5,1+
B 2,6 --&amp;gt; 5,7+
C 2,1+ ( for the test I cheated on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need 
A 4,8 --&amp;gt; 5,1+
C 2,0 --&amp;gt; 2,4+ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d end up with either a 5 or two  fives ( subject X)  If I pass subject X, I&amp;#39;ll only have to improve either A or C a tiny bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve made passing a bit easier, and my final score higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like the 2,1 for C would have been incredibly easy, since I knew the subject well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the 5,7 for B would take a considerable amount of time. And since I have a lower chance there, I won&amp;#39;t be retaking it. So my knowledge will remain at the 2,6. ( I had no idea what the test was even about) And now, I&amp;#39;ll lack this material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now that you undertand my situation, onto the actual cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I had to take this test which was still from the second period today, after my last third period test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other people taking missed tests but mine had gone missing, and by the time I got it, the rest had already finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I got my own classroom, without even a teacher there. ( I couldn&amp;#39;t bring my books and there was no one else to talk with, so they thought it&amp;#39;d be fine.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got one hour to finish it, and then they left me alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I was aiming for that 2,1 which should be very do-able. I have literally never cheated and I still had no intention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, my honor was put to the test. I found out that with my test, came the answer key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By accident they&amp;#39;d given me the entire &amp;#39;test 2&amp;#39; file, both the questions for the students, and the answers for the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was alone, would be for at least an hour, and I&amp;#39;d been given all the aswers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this had happened before. But I was not alone and it was a subject I&amp;#39;d have aced regardless. So, I immediately told them they&amp;#39;d accidentally given me the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was different, I could 100% get away with it. And I hadn&amp;#39;t yet received my other grades, so I didn&amp;#39;t know the conseqences on my chance of passing the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to turn it in, but then I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;What would any other teenage boy do in this situation?&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d go to great lenghts to cheat, was I really going to turn this in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been dealt a pretty shitty hand this year, and because of stress, I got screwed even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;( I didn&amp;#39;t know there was a last page on a test for a subject I usually ace, it was even the one exercise I was most confident in. I ended up with a 5,6 but needed a 5,9. That last page could have gotten me a 7,6 easily. Which is what I usually get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it would only be fair if I took advantage, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, school has helped me. But I still needed to take the same amount of test in the same amount of time, third period was lots of stress, and I wasn&amp;#39;t even fully recovered yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I fail this year because of this one test? What if this makes the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go for it. Though I hadn&amp;#39;t yet figured out how I would explain I had the answer key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up only answering the questions I understood, and could explain in my own words. The rest I left open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I could have answered those questions myself, and gotten the same score. But I might have been soft on myself, you always end up losing points to those questions you &amp;#39;totally knew&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d put the answer sheet under the questions so I could easily cover them up and pretend I didn&amp;#39;t see them. I did this unnecessarily a few times, but  eventually the teacher actually did come in. Luckily I was fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I naively asked if my time was up already,( not even close, and I knew that )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d said he&amp;#39;d suddenly realized he might have accidentally given me the answers, so he went digging through my pile of papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d set things up perfectly, so it seemed like they were still just under my testpaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretended to be surprised, even made a corny &amp;#39;if only I had known earlier.&amp;#39; Joke &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He bought it, and just took them with him.
I&amp;#39;d already finished copying, so I didn&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat out my time, and handed in the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aced it 8,0 not ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my mom will definitely take notice, and I&amp;#39;ll have to pretend to be happy with my grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made passing conditions easier, and will now lack knowledge on subject B. So, I might enter next year unprepeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel bad, and I&amp;#39;m not sure what I should tell my mom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel like I didn&amp;#39;t really pass. And that I&amp;#39;m only fooling myself, so I&amp;#39;ll eventually fall because I&amp;#39;m not really prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a hard worker, and I find satisfaction in knowing I'm a good employee.

After having my son, and gaining custody of my husband's daughter, we realized daycare was WAY too expensive and it was pointless for me to work full time.  I dropped down to part time and worked opposite of my husband, which worked for a while.  Then, over the past 6 months to a year, I started working nights to guarantee I'll be home every day for the kids.

But, starting August 19th, both kiddos will be in school full time.  Which means I have no reason NOT to work full time during the day.  I could work first shift (I work in an ER) from 7A-3P and be home before they're off the bus.  

Financially, we need me to work more.  We only make ends meet, but that's due to debt from the court fees, which we'll be rid of in the next 1-2 years.  But I don't want to work full time.  I want a break.  I NEED a break.

I'm the main caregiver for both kids, and I've always worked at least part time since I was 16.  I'm 32 now, and raising the kids full time while working nights and TRYING to find time to sleep is absolutely exhausting.  My husband is fine with me staying part time, but my family expects me to 'do something' with my life.  I guess being a mom and working isn't enough.  

So, I've applied for jobs...but they're jobs I don't think I'm qualified for, so I doubt I'll even get an interview.  I did it on purpose, because I want to delay me working full time as much as possible.  I want to have some days to just breathe.  To not be Mom or Worker or Wife, but Me.

I dropped down to part time and worked opposite of my husband, which worked for a while.  Then, over the past 6 months to a year, I started working nights to guarantee I&amp;#39;ll be home every day for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, starting August 19th, both kiddos will be in school full time.  Which means I have no reason NOT to work full time during the day.  I could work first shift (I work in an ER) from 7A-3P and be home before they&amp;#39;re off the bus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financially, we need me to work more.  We only make ends meet, but that&amp;#39;s due to debt from the court fees, which we&amp;#39;ll be rid of in the next 1-2 years.  But I don&amp;#39;t want to work full time.  I want a break.  I NEED a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the main caregiver for both kids, and I&amp;#39;ve always worked at least part time since I was 16.  I&amp;#39;m 32 now, and raising the kids full time while working nights and TRYING to find time to sleep is absolutely exhausting.  My husband is fine with me staying part time, but my family expects me to &amp;#39;do something&amp;#39; with my life.  I guess being a mom and working isn&amp;#39;t enough.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve applied for jobs...but they&amp;#39;re jobs I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m qualified for, so I doubt I&amp;#39;ll even get an interview.  I did it on purpose, because I want to delay me working full time as much as possible.  I want to have some days to just breathe.  To not be Mom or Worker or Wife, but Me.  Maybe then I could actually figure out what I want to do career-wise, instead of just picking another dead end job.&lt;/p&gt;

On my way back into town yesterday, after spending all 4th of July week at my fiancee's parents place in a small town a while away, I saw an SUV blow a tire and flip 4 or 5 times down an embankment. Their windows were all wore down and one woman wasn't wearing a seat-belt so she was ejected from one of the passenger windows. Us and a dozen other cars pulled over to go help and assist the people in the wreck. When I got up to the car it was still upside down and people were able to pull a small girl out completely unharmed. We were also able to get a small boy out but his face was cut up horribly. There was blood all over the side of the car. It was probably the most disturbing thing I've seen in my entire life.

There wasa group of people near the woman who was ejected but I'm not sure about her status as, Emergency teams showed up shortly and I backed off to let them work freely. 

It was almost a completely silent ride home as both of us were trying to process what we just saw. I had never seen gore/morbid things in real life and I haven't been able to shake this uneasy/anxious feeling since leaving the scene.

&amp;#x200B;

I dated a girl for 6 years. On and off, but even when we weren't dating we were very close friends. And for those 6 years I treated her like shit. Gaslighting, manipulating and using her. In my mind it seemed perfectly normal, she even thought so too. I was her first boyfriend and I was all she ever experienced. We stayed in our little bubble for almost 6 years, of her constantly trying to please me and me being unpleasable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't let her hang out with any of her male friends . If we were at her place she would act different with her family to make sure I was pleased. I wouldn't let her go out clubbing with her friends. And I would throw a tantrum if she did any of these things. She would apologise and I would be angry at her for a while to make sure it settled in on her. We always did what I wanted no matter what She was a very quiet girl and never really pushed back on me, which I guess I took advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved her. I still do. Somehow in my sick and twisted brain I cared for her very deeply. I made myself believe that all my rules were to keep her safe and happy. I have never met someone more interesting, compassionate and beautiful as she is. I only noticed that I was such a terrible boyfriend when I saw my older brother do the same thing to his girlfriend when she wanted to go out. I saw me, and I was disgusted by what I had been doing.

&amp;#x200B;

We broke up about a year ago, and I haven't had any contact since. She has moved on, better life, better man. And I spend every day aching over everything I could have done differently to change how things turn out. I have to physically tell myself to not think about her every night I close my eyes. I cry most days, pathetic I know. But if after 12 months I am still hung up on her, I am pathetic. I hate myself now. And I have for a long time. I find myself worrying I cant live in a world devoid of someone like her in my life. I have had girls come and go, but they always feel temporary.

&amp;#x200B;

I am almost suicidal. The only thing stopping me is that I deserve to live in this world I created. Without my soul mate. With the knowledge it was my actions that have ruined her. And ruined my life. This is my payback. My penance for my sins. I don't expect forgiveness from any of you, I just needed to finally write down what I have known all this time;

Often after these sessions I recall a lot of buried memories.

From a young age I was subjected to physical, emotional, and verbal abuse from my mother with physical and emotional neglect. Due to this I became a fairly easy target for sexual abuse so I was also molested by my grandfather, my grandma's boyfriend, my brother, and later my friend's parents tried to proposition me to a 3 way when I was 11. A lot of the sexual abuse was random and opportunistic with it mainly occurring between the ages of 4-12 years old rather than systematic like my mother's physical, verbal, and emotional abuse. When I told my mother of anything i was a ""liar"" yet then during several of her episodes when attacking me she would admit that her father (my grandfather) sexually abused her and her sisters.

One of the worst of those was when she took me to one of her sister's graves when I was about 8 years old. She started detailing to me the child about how her father raped her sister and her sister was trying to leave home but died in a car crash instead, being 8 years old I didn't know how to respond so my mother started beating me up in a cemetery near her sister's grave calling me a cunt and bitch because I didn't respond in a way she expected. On the flip side despite never emotionally supporting me my mother expected me to be her counsellor and punching bag.

Years later when I was 15 I was being a dickhead in school so I got suspended. I knew my mother was going to have a field day with this one so a beating, getting spat on, and verbal abuse wasn't a surprise (the best part is my POS older sister came to watch with excitement over the whole show). However this time my mother amped it up where she made me put dry clothes back on the clothes line, while I was frantically putting these on the line my mother was screaming abuse at me and hitting me then decided to say she was pulling me out of school altogether to go live with my grandfather. That's when she started detailing about how he will *play* with me and rape me like that was a normal response to school suspension: she was going to intentionally send me to get incestuously raped by her father. 

In my teens and growing up with abuse it just made me depressed and sad. As an adult I would beat the ever living shit out of her if she ever said this to me again or if I saw her saying this to anyone else. It's one of the many reasons I will not have her in my future, even with my bitch sister my mother would do everything she didn't want to do for example: if my sister didn't want her daughter eating honey or climbing trees, no feet on the coffee table, don't drink from the container, etc. My mother would go out of her way to feed my sister's daughter honey, put her in trees, put her feet on the coffee table, and drink from containers then think she was so smart and funny for disrespecting my sister's minor house rules.

I talked to my psychologist about this and she mentioned it's most likely a control thing. Hence even if by miracle my mother finally acknowledged how much of a POS she is (which she won't) then admitted to and apologised for her actions she still couldn't be a part of my family because she would disregard any rule I had, just to prove ""look what I can do! I'm so smart by doing the opposite of what you say"". Another thing is my mother is one of those people who thinks they're clever if they out smart a child. I wouldn't want an adult like that around any future children of mine.

Meanwhile my mother has convinced herself there was never any abuse then on the rare occasions she slips up and admits to it, she isn't upset by what she did but more of what people will think about her if they knew.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m receiving trauma therapy for an abusive childhood.

&lt;p&gt;Years later when I was 15 I was being a dickhead in school so I got suspended. I knew my mother was going to have a field day with this one so a beating, getting spat on, and verbal abuse wasn&amp;#39;t a surprise (the best part is my POS older sister came to watch with excitement over the whole show). However this time my mother amped it up where she made me put dry clothes back on the clothes line, while I was frantically putting these on the line my mother was screaming abuse at me and hitting me then decided to say she was pulling me out of school altogether to go live with my grandfather. That&amp;#39;s when she started detailing about how he will &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with me and rape me like that was a normal response to school suspension: she was going to intentionally send me to get incestuously raped by her father. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my teens and growing up with abuse it just made me depressed and sad. As an adult I would beat the ever living shit out of her if she ever said this to me again or if I saw her saying this to anyone else. It&amp;#39;s one of the many reasons I will not have her in my future, even with my bitch sister my mother would do everything she didn&amp;#39;t want to do for example: if my sister didn&amp;#39;t want her daughter eating honey or climbing trees, no feet on the coffee table, don&amp;#39;t drink from the container, etc. My mother would go out of her way to feed my sister&amp;#39;s daughter honey, put her in trees, put her feet on the coffee table, and drink from containers then think she was so smart and funny for disrespecting my sister&amp;#39;s minor house rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to my psychologist about this and she mentioned it&amp;#39;s most likely a control thing. Hence even if by miracle my mother finally acknowledged how much of a POS she is (which she won&amp;#39;t) then admitted to and apologised for her actions she still couldn&amp;#39;t be a part of my family because she would disregard any rule I had, just to prove &amp;quot;look what I can do! I&amp;#39;m so smart by doing the opposite of what you say&amp;quot;. Another thing is my mother is one of those people who thinks they&amp;#39;re clever if they out smart a child. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want an adult like that around any future children of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile my mother has convinced herself there was never any abuse then on the rare occasions she slips up and admits to it, she isn&amp;#39;t upset by what she did but more of what people will think about her if they knew.&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend of 4 years left me for someone he'd met five days prior. We had just started long distance (college) so this was all over text. I had been with him since I was 14. We grew up together. We were attached, like those trees in the woods that have grown intertwined with one another. I cannot even put the pain into words. To make matters worse, he changed his mind at least 6 times over the next 8 months. Every time we'd talk, he'd say he's in love with me, misses me so much, and he thinks he wants to be together again. Then, he'd say actually I can't be with you. 

I am sick now. I am so mentally ill. I act like I'm recovered and totally fine, all my friends think I'm happy. I'm not. Sometimes I sit on the bathroom floor and cry, and I feel like I'm going to burst. I feel like I've gone crazy. I obsess over everything that happened. I search him up daily. I don't feel a single damn emotion for any other guy I've met. I don't think I ever will.

I just scream sometimes because I can't get rid of him or what happened out of my body, out of my mind. I'm so fucked up now I don't even think I could love someone else. He doesn't even know. Everytime we've talked, I forgive him and I tell him it's all okay. He thinks we are friends now who can catch up every few months. We can. But I'm dying inside.

This has become more than just a break up. It's sent me into a depression so deep. It feels like a fucking disease in my brain driving me crazy. I once messaged him from an anonymous Instagram account because I was so desperate. Later, I had no clue why I did it. I feel like my brain and my heart isn't mine. 

I cry almost daily. When I don't cry, I just feel empty. My heart is an empty hole. I don't think I will ever get better. It's been almost year, and the only thing that could fix me would be getting back together with him. 

I would do anything to escape the pain and the fucked up feelings I feel and how agonizing it is. If killing yourself wasn't so god damn difficult, I would have done it by now.

I've thought about posting this before, and it'll probably be buried fast, but for those of you who took the time to read this thank you. 

I thought about doing this on a throwaway account, but honestly I doubt anyone who has my reddit irl doesn't have some idea what happened.

2 years ago I still lived with my parents. It was actually the last summer I lived with them, and I would have been 17 at the time. At the time my brother was 21 and home from college for the break. One of his and my good friends lived at the house and had for about 3 years because his family situation wasn't great and my parents took him in. We'll call him M, he was also 21. 

Being 21 year olds in America, they liked to drink, so when I came home from work one night I joined them. I am tiny with a low tolerance, so I can really only do about 4 shots before I am done. I noticed M doing about 10 shots or so, he was wasted noticeably. Nothing remarkable happened for awhile after that, just M, my brother, and his girlfriend and I all hanging out. I am mostly on my phone texting my girlfriend and he is on his phone texting his gf. 

Eventually my brother and his girlfriend wanted to go to bed so M and I sit in the livingroom where he sleeps on the futon. We joked around about dumb shit per usual, as we had been friends for over 3+ years at this point. I don't remember much but I ended up passed out slumped over in a ball on the side of the futon while it was still up like a couch. 

I awoke to someone touching me. Something inside me. My underwear had been pulled down. I was disoriented and confused, but then I heard M moan my name. It put me in a state of shock. I feel like I laid there for way too long before reacting. It eats me up inside. Once I got ahold of my senses I jumped up and started swinging. I few landed on his face. I screamed at him to get out. Suddenly my parents come flying down the hall. My brother and his girlfriend came out of the bedroom into the living room. They asked me what happened and I broke.

I don't know why I couldn't tell them. I don't know why I still wanted to protect him. But I did. I lied to everyone and told them it was just a bad dream and I was freaked out but nothing actually happened.

I hid away in my room. The next morning he had moved out and moved in with my sister across town. He admitted that he couldn't bare to live with me if he hurt me like that. He kept saying he doesn't remember anything. 

Some of my family are still friends with him on Facebook and keep in contact with him.

In a way, I know I am. 

I’m a different kind of fucked up but I’d fail miserably if I tried to explain to anyone what truly makes up my actual ‘personality’, I know that it’s physically impossible for me to do so. I need approval. I need love. I need adoration. Honestly, since this is the internet and posts on this sub don’t get read too often anyway, I feel like I could share this: I know I’m a likeable person.

Regardless of my cripplingly low self-esteem and burning self-hatred, I am aware that I’m a charismatic individual. People like me. I am introduced to a new group, I leave with the knowledge that I left behind good impressions, I start a new class and immediately befriend almost everyone, I meet someone’s parents and they later on tell me about how lovely they thought I was. I know this, because I know how people work. 

And that’s the thing. I know they like me because I know what to do in order to get them to like me. 

And it’s not even a strictly manipulative thing, something I do consciously when meeting someone new – it’s my nature. Like I assess people upon first glance and instinctively know what to say, what not to say, how to act. 

I don’t even change or play pretend – it’s more about what past stories to emphasize, which details to leave out, when to be quiet. I know what to do and how to do it, and I don’t think anyone in my life actually knows the extent of this. I have a relatively large amount of friends – not one group but lots of individual people who I  do wholeheartedly love and adore – but it’s hard to myself understand which parts of myself are natural and which ones I’ve engrained in myself because ‘that’s what people like’. 

I don’t know how much of my caring, deep-rooted love and all the support I give the people in my life is motivated simply by the need to be loved and how much of it is just a regular part of who I am. The closer I get to people, the more intense it becomes. I can’t just be a friend. I need to be Number one. I need to be the first person they call when something goes wrong, I need to be the one they can have the most deep and personal conversations with, I need to be the most important friend of them all – or else I’m nothing. Nothing at all. 

And it’s not like this harms my friends – I would say that I’m a very great friend to have actually – but I do wonder sometimes. About how much of this is just a desire to be loved, adored, and appreciated. Am I playing them? Am I acting? I don’t even know. The feelings I harbor for them are very real and the strong sense of loyalty and this feeling like it is my duty to make sure they are safe, to protect them are also very real - at the same time I can't help but realise that I like to portray myself as a better person than I actually am. I can't deal with the concept of people knowing about the parts of myself I deem unlikeable, disgusting, can't deal with the possibility of them *finding out*. I don't even know what they could find out. 

I just know that I bend backwords for people, move mountains in order to please, to make sure I leave a favourable imprint in someone's head. Even though most of my day is spent being somewhat angry at everything and everyone, even though I couldn't count the times I've felt nothing but pure hatred for my friends, hatred because I felt unappreciated, because of envy, because of being lied to once again, used for my supposed kindness. I hate them with a burning passion. I hate them because they don't have to be me. I'm so envious of that. I'm envious of their money, their possessions, the appreciation others have for them, I'm envious of their mental state, their drive, their appearance. 

The more I try to give up the fiercer that hatred grows - it's gotten to the point where I don't even want to meet up with my best friend because I'm so hurt/angry at her more distant behaviour this past month. It hurts me, to hate them. 

It hurts because even though I hold this romantic stance on relationships, putting them on a pedestal, they're all tainted by none other than myself.

At the age of 6, I was raped by my own grandpa. At that time he had been talking about sex around me and kept complimenting me and saying I was pretty. Being a 6-year old I didn't understand what all this meant so I accepted all the compliments.  Then one night he came into my room and started touching and put his member in me. I screamed and no one came. I went to school in the following weeks and felt dirty. I felt like everything that happened to me had happened to everyone else. So I didn't tell anyone. I grew up poor and bothering my family would be too hard for them. my only source of venting was my dog and well a couple of weeks later after the incident with my grandpa, my dog had been shot. I was only 6 and everything was happening too fast. I had no one at school and no one at home. My parents were getting a divorce and because of the fights, my dad would put his anger out on me and abuse me. He would call me useless and tell me to kill myself. At the age of 9, I had been diagnosed with depression and my whole world had turned black and white.  This was when I tried to commit suicide for the first time. I tried to overdose on pills but my mom caught me before I could. This is when I started seeing a therapist and had been monitored 24/7. I was bullied very badly, and I had no friends. The bullying went on to the point where the people who were bullying me broke my arm. Everyone just thought I had tripped.

At that time he had been talking about sex around me and kept complimenting me and saying I was pretty. Being a 6-year old I didn&amp;#39;t understand what all this meant so I accepted all the compliments.  Then one night he came into my room and started touching and put his member in me. I screamed and no one came. I went to school in the following weeks and felt dirty. I felt like everything that happened to me had happened to everyone else. So I didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone. I grew up poor and bothering my family would be too hard for them. my only source of venting was my dog and well a couple of weeks later after the incident with my grandpa, my dog had been shot. I was only 6 and everything was happening too fast. I had no one at school and no one at home. My parents were getting a divorce and because of the fights, my dad would put his anger out on me and abuse me. He would call me useless and tell me to kill myself. At the age of 9, I had been diagnosed with depression and my whole world had turned black and white.  This was when I tried to commit suicide for the first time. I tried to overdose on pills but my mom caught me before I could. This is when I started seeing a therapist and had been monitored 24/7. I was bullied very badly, and I had no friends. The bullying went on to the point where the people who were bullying me broke my arm. Everyone just thought I had tripped. Then I met the person who made me happy for once, let&amp;#39;s say his name was Will. He made me happy, but sadly I had to move to the other side of the world to where we were living at the moment.

For someone who didn't got grew up with a brother or sister and father.  Most of the time I felt lonely. I still had my mother ofcourse but she worked a lot and in some ways wasn't there for me that much.

In a summer holiday in '03 there were stray cats living in our garden. And at the time I really wanted to have a pet, whether that be a dog, cat or something else. My mother always disliked having the idea of me owning a pet because she wasn't sure I would have the responsibility to take care of it.

Now there was one particular young stray cat that felt curious to enter our home . The 'at the time' boyfriend of my mother was able to quickly close the frontdoor and in a way captured that young stray cat into my home.
My mother arrived shortly from her work and saw  that young stray cat nerviously sitting underneeth the kitchen table. I explained what happened and begged her to keep the cat and that i'll prove that i'll be very responsible towards the cat.
After some persuasion from me (and with the help of my mother's boyfriend), I was able to keep that young cat. And boy, I was the happiest kid in the world!

Over the years I grew really fond of my pet cat and in a way we created a close bond (sounds weird perhaps but it's true). This cat was really wild if he wanted to play, usually claws were involved but we never minded that (until he went too far and started to hurt us ofcourse). It was never a dull moment watching him play. Or he had times he wouldn't do anything productive and just chill all day. He was a very nice cat, very loveable when you get to know his personality. And demanded lot's of attention which I always liked giving him. He was always around when I called out his name, in a way I never felt alone anymore.

In the summer of '06 I went abroad for 1 month on a sport camp. This was the first time I went away from home for a long periode of time.
At camp we were allowed to call our parents from time to time. Apart from talking to my mother I also asked how things were with our pet cat. According to my mother our cat was acting very strangly, walking to every corner around the house like he's looking for something or someone. He meows more often than he used too. One day my mother couldn't find our cat for a whole day, which was really odd since he would always come back home after we call out his name.
My mother did the laundry that day and went up the stairs to put my clothes in my bedroom, upon which she surprisingly  found our cat sleeping on my pillow. ( The door for going up the house using the staircase was apparently open, we normally always close that door because our pet cat wasn't allowed to go upstairs.)
When I got back from sport camp and finally arrived home I saw my cat looking out the window. I called out his name, he slowly turned his face around and looked at me with a surprised yet happy expression with wide open eyes. You clearly saw how happy he looked when he saw me again. He ran at me like a cheetah and jumped at me with full joy. It was truly a memorable moment .

In the begining of 2012 is where everything went dark. It wasn't a good time in our lives, we had to move out to different homes almost every year...
In the last home we got, my cat seemed extremely happy. He would roll around on the floor in almost every spot in and out of the house.
One morning I discoverd a big dead insect on the floor close to my pet cat. Obviously my cat killed it but I was in a way shocked what that insect was and hoped my cat didn't got poisend or something b/c it wasn't anything like I've ever seen before.

Days go by and we notice that my cat stopped eating and drinking. Something was clearly wrong and we rushed him to a vet. The vet saw nothing wrong, also no indication he was poisoned. He gave us some medication for our cat and that was it.
We had to force feed our cat (with medication) and give him water because when the medication would wear off his condition was just getting worse. He lost weight and therefore strenght and every night he would sleep very badly, he was somehow in constant pain. When he couldn't sleep well on his own I took him onto my bed to let him sleep with me and in some way he was able to sleep a bit better. But he still struggled in his sleep, I kept awake almost every night so that everything is ok with him. Me and my mother often swiched roles so that I could sleep well and she would stay awake and guard over him.

The reality of him going to die soon was starting to come closer and it was killing me on the inside. Because it wasn't just any pet cat that I would lose, it was my pet cat. One I considered as a close companion in life. An animal that i've had a close bond with. In a way was familiy to me.
One morning before my mother went to work she came into my bedroom and would look at how our pet cat was holding up as he was lieing close to me in my bed.
On 14th of March 2012 at 8:45AM my pet cat died in my arms. It felt like a rock that was attached around my heart that suddenly felt 10 times heavier than before and dragged it down into a bodemless pit that grew darker and darker the deeper it went.
 I was devasted and felt alone again.


Now everytime I go to the grocery store I always avoid going through the pet food supplies aisle because it reminds me of my house pet that died years ago. From which I still grieve from to this day...
To me, my pet cat can't be replaced. 

TL;DR: had a lonely childhood and always wanted to have a pet. Adopted a stray cat and instantly grew fond of it. Never felt alone anymore. Went abroad for a long period of time, after I returned my pet cat showed he missed me. In a way me and my cat had a strong bond for each other. Later my pet got unexplainably ill.

Hi reddit, let's get straight to the point.... i'm a 19f and as the title says, i can't stop eating my boogers.

Let me start the story off with my very first memory of getting caught snacking on my nose goo. I was in first grade and my class got sent to the library to watch a movie... it was a very dark room... no one was paying attention to me, or so i thought, and right as I slipped one in my mouth I lock eyes with this kid, he looks at me and with his hand, pretended to lock his mouth shut. Ever since this moment I knew i had to be more secretive about this, it wasn't something that was very accepted, so I resorted to saving them for when I went to the bathroom when out in public, but at home was free game because i had my own room and a decent amount of alone time, I could pick my nose and eat em as I pleased.

The second and last time I ever got caught was actually at home a couple of years later... I was in my room with my mom and she was showing me something on her iPad, i casually sneaked one and didn't think she wouldn't notice, but that thought was short lived, since my mom paused what she was talking about to ask ""Did you just eat a booger?"" I was petrified and quickly denied it and tried to steer back the conversation. Looking back on it know, I'm pretty sure she knew I was lying, but she never said anything about it after that. This is when i confined all booger eating to when i was in the bathroom, it was the only place i could freely eat my nasty boogs in peace.

When I was in junior year of high school I met my boyfriend, he was and still is the most perfect person in my eyes, I love him so much. After a month of dating I decided he needed to know my terrible secret, I had to tell him he's kissing booger mouth. I was scared to say the least, I had never told anyone this and it possibly could have ended the relationship. I remember saying i had something to tell him, I sat him down, and i came clean. His response? ""I know."" I pretty much died of embarrassment right there, he said he'd seen me do it a couple times but wanted to wait to say something until he caught me in the act. On one hand i was very relieved that he didn't think it was a big deal, but on the other hand, that means I had been picking my nose and eating the boogers in public again without realizing, and since then I saved all nose picking booger harvesting for when I'm in the bathroom.

Honestly I don't know why I eat them, I've tried multiple times to stop myself but i subconsciously keep coming back. Every time I would pick my nose while trying to get rid of this nasty habit i would just eat them without thinking about it or realizing. Whenever my boyfriend sees me do it he teases me about it, he doesn't do it and doesn't understand why I do but he leaves it at that and so do I. Looking at the future I really can't see myself stopping, they're like, my little snacks, and every time I blow my nose into a tissue I regret it because fuck I could have eaten that. What the fuck is wrong with me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this on &lt;a href=""/r/confession""&gt;r/confession&lt;/a&gt; but this sub seems a little more lighthearted.

Then that mam[F2] told me alone with all the students involved there about life and we are to face our problems and not be afraid with any questions, it was somehow correct.

People have told me to try hypnotherapy but honestly, I don’t think I want to remember. After I escaped I was placed into a much better but still not favourable situation. Following an incident involving domestic abuse, I decided I would be better off on my own no matter how difficult it was going to be giving that I’d just turned 16 and could then legally leave. 

I was couch surfing when I met this guy, we will call him T. He was 19 turning 20. He told me he was homeless. That he had a son but his mother had been messing him around and had slept with his brother so he didn’t know if the kid was his or his brothers. That his father was abusive. Just about how terrible his life was. I believed him. Mistake number 1. As I later found out he was never homeless, he stayed with his Nan but both his Mum and Dad (who were separated) said he could stay with them as well, his child’s mother never slept with his brother or said anything along those lines, his father was never abusive and his life actually wasn’t that bad.

He slowly but surely gained my trust and one night he told me he had feelings for me. I guess I was just so tired of feeling like no one cared that I grabbed onto that with both hands. 

At the beginning it was just little lies. Which should have been a red flag but delusional 16 year old attention seeking me didn’t see it. Then it built... so slowly that I almost didn’t realise just how bad things were until I was in completely balls deep in a situation I had no idea how to get out of.

One of the first things that should have clicked was when we went to my grandmothers house. She was one of the only family members that ever cared about me so I was just focussed on spending time with her. I was excited. Not thinking about much else. We were staying the night so I put my jewellery in an empty hairspray lid on the bedside cabinet. My great-grandmothers ring and some costume jewellery. The ring went missing but everything else stayed. He tried to convince me that it was my gran or my best friend. I believed him.

There was a few times he acted completely crazy but somehow I brushed that off too. For example - his son had to go to the hospital once to get a new mask thing fitted which when on the end of his inhaler. Not because he was sick. And T was on the floor screaming and crying saying his “baby boy was dying” and his “little miracle was being taken from him”, that it was “all her fault” (his sons mother) and when I tried to tell him his son was completely fine he stated calling me sick saying I “obviously wanted him to die” and “didn’t care” because I couldn’t even imagine what having or loosing a kid felt like. Side note - he said his son was like “little miracle” because he would often tell me he was unable to have kids and even the doctors were stunned when his girlfriend ended up pregnant. (Another lie but we will get onto that later).

For a while after that it was mainly just name calling and insulting me. Absolutely nothing compared to what was coming.

Over time he would tell me things. Things that I at the time just didn’t question but definitely should have. Like how he had ‘kidney problems’ or that his kidneys were failing and he would often take it as far as laying in bed doubled over in ‘agony’ and claiming that he had blood in his urine. I say claimed because once he told me to look and there was literally nothing there. Even pretending to attend doctors appointments. He would tell me he had SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and that’s the reason he got so angry all the time. He told me he had been a butcher, a first aider, a nurse, I could go on. He told me his family were involved with ‘bad people’ and would often tell me very graphic stories about things that they had done or could do to people. I later found out as I’m sure you can guess - he was perfectly healthy, didn’t have SAD, had never had a job, had only ‘worked’ in the butchers as part of a work experience program in high school and his family didn’t know any ‘bad people’. There are many more lies but I feel like I need to go into those in more detail. 

He would tell me he had OCD so he wouldn’t do any housework especially the dishes. He told me that he would wash his hands constantly and his hands were always red. It’s like he forgot that he lived with me. I knew he didn’t wash his hands excessively and I could see that his hands weren’t red. When he did do anything which was rare (maybe 4 or 5 times the entire 2 and a half years) he would use latex gloves (remember this for later it’s important). 

He never mentioned this till about 4 months into the relationship but he told me he was deaf in one ear and whenever I would walk on the wrong side of him he would get angry. It started off just being like “are you trying to make sure I can’t hear you” but escalated to him telling me I was a joke, that I was “rubbing it in his face how good it was being able to hear in both ears”, that I was disrespectful, and so much more. I later found out he could hear perfectly fine - after realising he would listen to music with headphones in both ears or if it was only one earphone he was listening with he would switch ears. And his family confirming he could hear. 
 
He was OBSESSED with video games. And I mean obsessed. He would play till the point he would get so angry about loosing he would be breaking things. One time when he was on the PlayStation I gave his son a stuffed toy to play with while I was making dinner. I came through for a minute to check how his son was and we were playing a game of catch when he accidentally threw the toy a bit too hard which landed on the couch behind T. His son jumped up to go get it, pulled on the wire attached to T’s controller as he was doing it, which pulled the controller out of T’s hand making him loose the game. In response, T turned round, grabbed the stuffed toy (which had large glass bead eyes) and threw it full force at my head and told me if I ever risked him loosing again I would be sorry. One of the glass beads smashed off of my forehead so hard it started bleeding and there was a raised bit. T told me I must’ve done it to myself to make him look like a bad person and completely denied throwing anything.

I had a dog but he made me get rid of her. I miss her every single day. He would deliberately annoy her so she would start barking (not aggressively just playful she literally wouldn’t have harmed a fly) and then smack her with a slipper for “trying to attack him”. She loved his son, and even through everything he done, I think she still tried to love him. Every time I tried to stop him and stand up for her he would just do it anyway and do something to me too. He started telling me he was scared she would hurt his son. I told him to leave then but he would just tell me that if I made him leave I would be putting a 2 year old out on the streets and he would tell everyone I was evil. I refused to get rid of her so he started telling me he would phone the local animal rescue and the police and say that she had attacked his son and make sure they would have her put to sleep. I realise now it’s not that simple but at the time I was terrified. So I gave in. I got rid of her. At that point I no longer had anything or anyone but him. He had drove me away from every friend, my remaining family and now my dog. He would tell me things like “everyone else has left you so how can you say I don’t care?”.

One time he was trying to get too close to me so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. He started shouting abuse, punched a hole in the door and threatening to phone the police saying I was going to kill myself, tell them I was crazy and have me sectioned, I told him to do it so I could tell them what was really happening and he started kicking the door so hard that he eventually tore the lock right out of the wood which came out in a massive chunk that flew towards me. At this point I was well aware he was a thief so I had my bank card on me at all times. As he came hurdling into the bathroom he demanded my bank card. I grabbed it from my back pocket as soon as he reached down and held onto it refusing to give him it. He said I would “see what I had done after he was finished with me”. He started trying to rip the bank card out of my hand so in complete panic I just snapped it which sent him into a complete rage. The door was already locked and he took the key out, none of my windows open wide enough to climb out of so I knew I was in trouble. I ran for my phone which was in the bedroom and he tackled me onto the bed, got my phone and shattered it against the wall. He screamed at me for hours and hours telling me I was worthless, ugly, fat, no one would ever love me, that my grandad (who was dying) would be ashamed of me, and an endless list that will forever be burned into my brain. Whenever I would cry it’s like it would make him angrier. 

I would pay for everything, council tax, rent, gas, electric, food, clothes, anything his son needed. I bought all of his birthday and Christmas presents which T told everyone he bought. I would do everything, clean, cook, look after his son, you name it. But one time he got a jar of coffee from his Mum, I made myself one and he just about lost his mind. He told me I was a thief and I didn’t ask him and I had to buy him a new jar. Yes a new jar because I used exactly one spoonful of coffee. When I paid for everything he owned. I even bought him a phone. And he would take £10 every week to go buy DVD’s from the local discount shop. 

One time he got a cheque for a tax return and told me if I gave him the £160 he would give me it back. I only had £180 and I was running out of money, fast. He said he would do it the next day he could (I’m pretty sure it was a weekend) so I gave him the money. He said he had been to the bank (which he hadn’t because I found the cheque under the bed) and they said they couldn’t process it into his bank account for some reason (obvious lie) so they were going to send it to him in cash through the mail. He then told me it got lost in the mail and they couldn’t find it so he didn’t know what to do. (Another obvious lie). I realised I was never getting the money back and just had to accept it. 

This is the part I’ve been terrified to write. I don’t even like to think about it. I makes me feel sick, to the pit of my fucking stomach. I’ve never told anyone in my real life and I never want to. I still don’t know if I’m over reacting or if it’s just the small voice in the back of my head that he left is telling me that I’m over reacting. When I first got with him he would tell me that it wasn’t a ‘real relationship’ if you weren’t having sex, and stuff like that. He told me he couldn’t wear a condom because he was allergic to latex. I told him about why I couldn’t take the pill or anything so asked if we could go to the doctor and find an alternative. He told me he already had and he wasn’t going again because they told him he couldn’t even wear the condoms that didn’t contain latex because they would irritate him and cause rashes. I believed him. Somehow. He told me he tried them once to make sure and he couldn’t even go to the toilet for days. I later realised that not only was he not allergic to the all natural ones he wasn’t allergic to latex either when I put 2 and 2 together and realised he was wearing latex gloves on the rare occasion he helped me out around the house. I’ve honestly never felt more violated in my life. I had a pregnancy scare at 16 fucking years old because of his sick twisted lies. I used to hate the things he would do to me, I never said no so I can’t actually blame him for the next bit but he would choke me to the point I couldn’t breathe and he would tell me “just pass out it will be fine” and other things that I literally can’t even bear to write. I know some people have kinks but this was different, you could see the evil in his eyes, you could see how badly he wanted to REALLY hurt you.

I think I started realising just how bad it was when I knew he stole money from my purse so I went into his bag and not only did I find that, I found my portable speaker, packets of cigarettes stolen from his family, other odd bits that more than likely weren’t his and the best of all - a key he had got himself cut for my door. 

And then.. One time he attacked me and I told him to get out. I finally plucked the courage from somewhere and told him to get the fuck out. I didn’t care about the consequences. Nothing could be worse than this. I lost my shit. To my surprise, he said he would go as long as I gave him my phone to let him phone his mum so he could ask to stay there. (He had to use mine because he would never pay for credit or a contract of his own). So I agreed. The SECOND his mum picked up the phone he went from a ball of rage to making crying sounds pretending to babble saying that I attacked him and he was scared begging his mum to help him. He started punching himself in the face screaming “she’s hitting me she’s hitting me” over and over. His mum phoned his dad who came to my house and I told his dad what happened and what T had said about him being abusive and he told me none of it was true. I don’t think he was lying. I think that planted a seed in his brain that I wasn’t the problem.

But of course, it doesn’t end there. 
He would stalk me to the point I had to go stay with my Gran for a while. I told him I was never going back to my house until I was moving but eventually I did. I would have never let him know.  I got online shops to avoid going outside and I absolutely would not go outside alone. I didn’t want to be in my own house. He would beg me to get back with him, one minute crying and begging, the next minute screaming at me in a complete rage, then crying again, then rage, and so on. He would text me saying he walked past my house and there people looking in my window. He would tell me his family had told people what I had done and they would find me. I would wake up to my door having things written on it. My plants destroyed. Rubbish scattered outside my house. Eventually it stopped, but it took so long. 

I’m so glad it’s over, but yet every time I see someone that looks like him my stomach completely drops, or when I smell aftershave he wore my heart races, the same fear sets in any time anything reminds me of him. I’ve stopped seeing people I’ve dated simply because they like the cult horrors like he did, or they make a facial expression a little too similar to his, even one guy who just typed in the exact same way he did. I know it’s not healthy to do that but anything that reminds me of him makes my stomach knot up and I just feel so small and end up thinking about everything. He might be gone but everything he done will stay with me forever. I hope karma really does exist.
I’m sorry this is so long. I had to get this out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To paint the picture - Until I was 9 I had a horrible upbringing - most of which I can’t remember because my brain has shut it out. People have told me to try hypnotherapy but honestly, I don’t think I want to remember. After I escaped I was placed into a much better but still not favourable situation. Following an incident involving domestic abuse, I decided I would be better off on my own no matter how difficult it was going to be giving that I’d just turned 16 and could then legally leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was couch surfing when I met this guy, we will call him T. He was 19 turning 20. He told me he was homeless. That he had a son but his mother had been messing him around and had slept with his brother so he didn’t know if the kid was his or his brothers. That his father was abusive. Just about how terrible his life was. I believed him. Mistake number 1. As I later found out he was never homeless, he stayed with his Nan but both his Mum and Dad (who were separated) said he could stay with them as well, his child’s mother never slept with his brother or said anything along those lines, his father was never abusive and his life actually wasn’t that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He slowly but surely gained my trust and one night he told me he had feelings for me. I guess I was just so tired of feeling like no one cared that I grabbed onto that with both hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning it was just little lies. Which should have been a red flag but delusional 16 year old attention seeking me didn’t see it. Then it built... so slowly that I almost didn’t realise just how bad things were until I was in completely balls deep in a situation I had no idea how to get out of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that should have clicked was when we went to my grandmothers house. She was one of the only family members that ever cared about me so I was just focussed on spending time with her. I was excited. Not thinking about much else. We were staying the night so I put my jewellery in an empty hairspray lid on the bedside cabinet. My great-grandmothers ring and some costume jewellery. The ring went missing but everything else stayed. He tried to convince me that it was my gran or my best friend. I believed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a few times he acted completely crazy but somehow I brushed that off too. For example - his son had to go to the hospital once to get a new mask thing fitted which when on the end of his inhaler. Not because he was sick. And T was on the floor screaming and crying saying his “baby boy was dying” and his “little miracle was being taken from him”, that it was “all her fault” (his sons mother) and when I tried to tell him his son was completely fine he stated calling me sick saying I “obviously wanted him to die” and “didn’t care” because I couldn’t even imagine what having or loosing a kid felt like. Side note - he said his son was like “little miracle” because he would often tell me he was unable to have kids and even the doctors were stunned when his girlfriend ended up pregnant. (Another lie but we will get onto that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while after that it was mainly just name calling and insulting me. Absolutely nothing compared to what was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time he would tell me things. Things that I at the time just didn’t question but definitely should have. Like how he had ‘kidney problems’ or that his kidneys were failing and he would often take it as far as laying in bed doubled over in ‘agony’ and claiming that he had blood in his urine. I say claimed because once he told me to look and there was literally nothing there. Even pretending to attend doctors appointments. He would tell me he had SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and that’s the reason he got so angry all the time. He told me he had been a butcher, a first aider, a nurse, I could go on. He told me his family were involved with ‘bad people’ and would often tell me very graphic stories about things that they had done or could do to people. I later found out as I’m sure you can guess - he was perfectly healthy, didn’t have SAD, had never had a job, had only ‘worked’ in the butchers as part of a work experience program in high school and his family didn’t know any ‘bad people’. There are many more lies but I feel like I need to go into those in more detail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would tell me he had OCD so he wouldn’t do any housework especially the dishes. He told me that he would wash his hands constantly and his hands were always red. It’s like he forgot that he lived with me. I knew he didn’t wash his hands excessively and I could see that his hands weren’t red. When he did do anything which was rare (maybe 4 or 5 times the entire 2 and a half years) he would use latex gloves (remember this for later it’s important). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He never mentioned this till about 4 months into the relationship but he told me he was deaf in one ear and whenever I would walk on the wrong side of him he would get angry. It started off just being like “are you trying to make sure I can’t hear you” but escalated to him telling me I was a joke, that I was “rubbing it in his face how good it was being able to hear in both ears”, that I was disrespectful, and so much more. I later found out he could hear perfectly fine - after realising he would listen to music with headphones in both ears or if it was only one earphone he was listening with he would switch ears. And his family confirming he could hear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was OBSESSED with video games. And I mean obsessed. He would play till the point he would get so angry about loosing he would be breaking things. One time when he was on the PlayStation I gave his son a stuffed toy to play with while I was making dinner. I came through for a minute to check how his son was and we were playing a game of catch when he accidentally threw the toy a bit too hard which landed on the couch behind T. His son jumped up to go get it, pulled on the wire attached to T’s controller as he was doing it, which pulled the controller out of T’s hand making him loose the game. In response, T turned round, grabbed the stuffed toy (which had large glass bead eyes) and threw it full force at my head and told me if I ever risked him loosing again I would be sorry. One of the glass beads smashed off of my forehead so hard it started bleeding and there was a raised bit. T told me I must’ve done it to myself to make him look like a bad person and completely denied throwing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dog but he made me get rid of her. I miss her every single day. He would deliberately annoy her so she would start barking (not aggressively just playful she literally wouldn’t have harmed a fly) and then smack her with a slipper for “trying to attack him”. She loved his son, and even through everything he done, I think she still tried to love him. Every time I tried to stop him and stand up for her he would just do it anyway and do something to me too. He started telling me he was scared she would hurt his son. I told him to leave then but he would just tell me that if I made him leave I would be putting a 2 year old out on the streets and he would tell everyone I was evil. I refused to get rid of her so he started telling me he would phone the local animal rescue and the police and say that she had attacked his son and make sure they would have her put to sleep. I realise now it’s not that simple but at the time I was terrified. So I gave in. I got rid of her. At that point I no longer had anything or anyone but him. He had drove me away from every friend, my remaining family and now my dog. He would tell me things like “everyone else has left you so how can you say I don’t care?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time he was trying to get too close to me so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. He started shouting abuse, punched a hole in the door and threatening to phone the police saying I was going to kill myself, tell them I was crazy and have me sectioned, I told him to do it so I could tell them what was really happening and he started kicking the door so hard that he eventually tore the lock right out of the wood which came out in a massive chunk that flew towards me. At this point I was well aware he was a thief so I had my bank card on me at all times. As he came hurdling into the bathroom he demanded my bank card. I grabbed it from my back pocket as soon as he reached down and held onto it refusing to give him it. He said I would “see what I had done after he was finished with me”. He started trying to rip the bank card out of my hand so in complete panic I just snapped it which sent him into a complete rage. The door was already locked and he took the key out, none of my windows open wide enough to climb out of so I knew I was in trouble. I ran for my phone which was in the bedroom and he tackled me onto the bed, got my phone and shattered it against the wall. He screamed at me for hours and hours telling me I was worthless, ugly, fat, no one would ever love me, that my grandad (who was dying) would be ashamed of me, and an endless list that will forever be burned into my brain. Whenever I would cry it’s like it would make him angrier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would pay for everything, council tax, rent, gas, electric, food, clothes, anything his son needed. I bought all of his birthday and Christmas presents which T told everyone he bought. I would do everything, clean, cook, look after his son, you name it. But one time he got a jar of coffee from his Mum, I made myself one and he just about lost his mind. He told me I was a thief and I didn’t ask him and I had to buy him a new jar. Yes a new jar because I used exactly one spoonful of coffee. When I paid for everything he owned. I even bought him a phone. And he would take £10 every week to go buy DVD’s from the local discount shop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time he got a cheque for a tax return and told me if I gave him the £160 he would give me it back. I only had £180 and I was running out of money, fast. He said he would do it the next day he could (I’m pretty sure it was a weekend) so I gave him the money. He said he had been to the bank (which he hadn’t because I found the cheque under the bed) and they said they couldn’t process it into his bank account for some reason (obvious lie) so they were going to send it to him in cash through the mail. He then told me it got lost in the mail and they couldn’t find it so he didn’t know what to do. (Another obvious lie). I realised I was never getting the money back and just had to accept it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part I’ve been terrified to write. I don’t even like to think about it. I makes me feel sick, to the pit of my fucking stomach. I’ve never told anyone in my real life and I never want to. I still don’t know if I’m over reacting or if it’s just the small voice in the back of my head that he left is telling me that I’m over reacting. When I first got with him he would tell me that it wasn’t a ‘real relationship’ if you weren’t having sex, and stuff like that. He told me he couldn’t wear a condom because he was allergic to latex. I told him about why I couldn’t take the pill or anything so asked if we could go to the doctor and find an alternative.

We left immediately and went to the nearest Walgreens. We had to stop by my house to pick up cash first. My mom hates constant plan changes(i was 15) and was super strict with curfew so I knew I'd need a perfect lie. If i was even a minute late, that's a whole day I'm forced to go straight home after work(summertime) or simply stay in all day. 

I told her i was skateboarding about 20 minutes away and she gave me until 11pm to get my gf home and to be home as well. 

I arrived at the walgreen's at about 9pm. They told me they stopped selling Plan B at 8pm for whatever reason. More panic came.

The only place that sold it was an hr walk away and closed at 10pm. I skated like my life depended on on it and arrived at 9:48. Bought it and some food before meeting back with my gf(she was walking still so i backtracked). After she took the pill we  decided to wait for the bus so I'd not have to rush home to make curfew. 

Now if you're  a new yorker, you know full well that no matter what, buses and trains never come on time. 30 minutes go by. It's 10:50 now. I know i won't make it. 

I decided I'd need to extend my lie, or fail at getting out of it unscathed, so I told my mom and sister that i was waiting for the bus near the park i was ""at."" I'd ""hit my ankle"" while trying a trick. After the bus finally still never came(11:16 now) we walk back and my gf is sad she probably won't see me for a while, and ofc the slim chance the pill failed.

After dropping her off, i skated until i was a block from home and practiced my limp until i got home. My mom told me to soak it and I took a bath. In there i realized my ankle wasn't even swollen, so i got my Gshock watch and while in the bath, lightly tapped it on my ankle until it appeared swollen.

So, if you have some kind of mental healt issue, please inform yourself of every thing you will face during the possible interviews, try to start by something small or simple, even with low pay, and work your way up from there, build resistance to stress, build your self confidence, etc.

&lt;p&gt;So, if you have some kind of mental healt issue, please inform yourself of every thing you will face during the possible interviews, try to start by something small or simple, even with low pay, and work your way up from there, build resistance to stress, build your self confidence, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of you this will sound like I am a gigantic pussy, but I don&amp;#39;t mind, every one has their own stuff to deal with, but I know there might be others strugling to get back on their feet, and finally getting a job and then getting fired after a couple of weeks might be very damaging mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

It was hard for me not to stare the whole time, and, frankly, I struggled so bad... Hell, I was strongly drawn to him like for fucking real. He was exactly my type, and admittedly he really looked alike to the only guy I've seriously crushed real hard on in my short life.

The guy in question was a manly masculine-looking stubbly guy on between about his late twenties to mid thirties, slightly above my height (≈5.9-6.0 ft. tall), excellent jawline and overall facial features, gorgeous green eyes, intense virile look, slightly-bushy eyebrows, straight dark brown hair he got styled in what seemed like a crew-cut fashion that in all honesty suited him perfectly and gave him that rough/badass/intimidating vibe I love in men; not to mention those awesome-looking biceps I got the honor to silently lust over and behold to. Not too big, not too small. Just them perfect bulgy guns I would die and melt for. Also, what to say about those insanely-hairy broad forearms of his, simply mouthwatering. Fuck.

Oh, yeah, and how would I forget about that solid well-worked body, hell... Also, along his nice chest you could tell he had a good amount of hair hiding under that black v-necked t-shirt he was wearing and that fitted and showed his built so nice and perfectly.

Since my parents and siblings were around and they're to this day clueless about my homosexuality-thing, I couldn't just be there overtly staring at him –more on the oggling side of it though, right? 😆– for too long, so each time I was able to I couldn't help but eyefuck him real bad. Of course on the outside I looked like a normal guy just randomly looking around, but on the inside I was full of lust and sexual thirst to the point that I was picturing us together, him having me straddle his meaty laps while we eyefucked at each other deeply, held one another passionately and got crazily touchy-feely with some hugging and some hot fondling getting us going prior to what would come next on that crazy fantasy of mine as part of what seemed like the foreplay of some intense and hot makeout that would lead to a good fuck. 

In the end, this guy didn't really get to assist us when charging us for the stuff we had bought and have it put into the bags, but hey, that was so nice to feel (and afterwards ""get frisky"" with while on my bed...😊😅🤣).


I want to add that despite me ""not being out"" nor being that outgoing to just casually do something suchlike –and least with someone I think is so much out of my league, right?–, this is the kind of guy I wouldn't mind asking out to or go for if it were mostly just the two of us in the place (the store was quite busy in terms of people working there) and relied on myself financially. It's certainly pretty much out of my character to act like that, but guess would be able to put myself out there and risk my own integrity either with a blow on my face, a rude ""hell no, I'm straight, dude. Fuck off, I no fag..."", or a polite ""no, I have a girlfriend/I'm straight"" in response.

Just in case you don't know, Winco is like a mix between Costco and Walmart. There are no memberships, but they sell some things in bulk. It is always crazy busy, and they never have more than 3 check out stands open even though they have around 12 available. Their customer service is behind those lines and is like a room.

One day, while waiting in their ridiculously long lines, I noticed that the customer service desk was checking out people too. I only had a few things, so I left my line, went through an empty checkout line, and went to customer service. They helped me quickly, and I resolved to never wait in a checkout line again.

The next time I went, even customer service had a long line. I did the same thing as I did the first time, but I had a crazy idea while I was waiting. I was watching customers leave the store and I noticed two things: 1. There was no one checking receipts at the door and 2. Most people did not bag their groceries. At this point, I had been inside the room for about 15 minutes and the line hadn't moved. I decided to simply walk out with my basket and see what happened. No one yelled after me or followed me out of the store, so I took my things and left.

Over the next few months, I perfected my strategy. I started bringing in a receipt to look at while I walked out. At first I only tried big stuff that wouldn't fit in bags, like cases of beer. I never ran into any problems, so I upgraded to a cart and tried more, smaller stuff. Eventually, I was filling my cart to the brim with anything and everything I could find. If there wasn't a line for me to wait a few minutes in, I started asking customer service questions. They would point me in the right direction of what I asked for and then I would leave the store with my receipt in hand. I only went when it was crazy busy.

I stocked my apartment with everything I could ever want. I took expensive bottles of liquor, steaks and seafood, grills, coolers, and folding chairs. I filled up my cabinets and freezer. I had more big cases of coronas than I knew what to do with. I kept taking the same amount of money out of my bank account each week, but I started spending it on all sorts of fun stuff instead of groceries. I saved a ton of money by not going out for drinks or food too.

Eventually I did get caught at one of the Wincos. A manager caught me on my way out the door, chewed me out for a few minutes, took my cart, and told me to never come back. I stopped doing it for a while just in case, and now I just skip that Winco.

At the age of 17 I wanted to kill myself if anything didnt change, i even looked up painless ways to kill yourself and i always had a “plan” if i wanted to end shit quickly, but i had a goal, something to look forward, i wanted to go to university and study something i enjoy a lot, that year was tough, between my depression and the stress the only thing that could evade me from my shitty perception of reality was smoking weed with one of my friends, we would do it almost every friday and I would forget about everything for a few hours until i got back home, and suddenly fell alone again. Fast foward a few months, i got accepted to university yay! I was excited and intrigued about the future for the first time in a long long time. First year of university was great, had fun and did make a lot of friends, I completely forgot how sociable i can be sometimes, whenever i was comfortable with myself. Many of my friends are impressed with my facility to go and chat shit to some random geeza i met 5 minutes ago. 

But this year everything changed again, i went back to old habbits, there would be days i would turn my phone off and sleep for over 30 hours just because i didn’t want to see anyone, i just wanted to be alone, because thats how i felt, alone at all times. My friends would show up and bang on my door to check if i was alright because i wouldnt answer my phone or texts for days and they worried about me, I always told them that i’ve been really busy with uni work and i’ve been going to sleep really late the last few days, thats why I couldn’t reply or phone back. My energy levels would be the same all year, lost a lot of appetite and would smoke every 20 minutes, now i belive i have anxiety aswell. Not so long ago, maybe about a month ago, few of my mates finished their degree and they invited me to go out for a boogie in a local club, i decided to go and just try to forget about all the shit that goes through my mind all the time. I did have fun, mainly because i was with people i enjoy being, but the atmosphere was shit, couldnt enjoy that. We only had a few drinks so i was not even drunk, quite sober to be fair. After the club we decided to have a pizza or something quick at one of those late night shops, after that we all went home and thats when everything started to go downhill. I was just watching a film and i was still really depressed, nothing new, same as usual but this time there was something different, i had an instinct, if you want to call it that way. That instinct was to kill myself, the only way getting out of that bad mindset, and stop being like this, was stop existing. So i went to the kitcken, grabbed a knife and just put it throught my wrist, did 2 cuts, not too deep to bleed out but deep enough to feel pain for a fair amount of time, and the marks were visible (still are, but much less), and at that moment, i felt alive, for the first time in years, i felt a rush of energy i havent felt, i couldnt sleep that day, it was too much for me, i’ve thought about it, but never actually been that close to doing it, it was more of a dream”/fantasy rather than a reality, but i guess some dreams can come true. 

Now a days im still really depressed, would i kill myself? Maybe, but now its not my moment, i got some shit to do and that kind of makes me a bit happier. I am with my parents back home for the summer and even tho we argue a lot its great to see them again. If anyone out there has gone/going through the same thing, well, keep it going brother, its a tough ride, but apparently living its worth it, why not give it a shot and try make the best out of it?

At this point a blind man comes up to me and my classmate (Who i knew already so we decided to travel together, keep in mind he is also not used to the big city) and asked us which Metro line goes to the station named ""Beurs"".

But, me being stupid, i read it wrong and told the man that he should take line C and that he had to wait 3 stops. The man said: "" Oh don't worry, The anouncer tells what stops are next so i know when I am there, But thank you very much young man, there are not  a lot of people like you anymore, who just help a helpless man. Thank you very much"" 
We shook hands and we parted our ways. I was happy and proud of myself. 

* 8 Minutes later *

Me and K found our Metro. We queitly laugh and look and some memes, when the announcer speaks:

"" NEXT STATION: BEURS, DON'T FORGET ANY PERSONAL BELONGINGS""

I look at K, and he at me.

I yelled out, without even thinking

FUUUCK

I took my phone, opened my P.T app, and check to where is Metro line C going?

I found out that i send that poor man to a completly different city....

I still to this day feel shitty for what I did.....

The whole class had to travel from home, on their own, to this clubhouse which meant using public transport.
Where I lived the only P.T we had where some buslines, so when I had to take the metro and stuff in the city, i really didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing.

So go ahead and grab a snack and enjoy reading my confession. :)

My husband and I went on vacation and have been wanting to try something new. We have had talks about doing a threesome (MMF) but it just never worked out. We were on a mission to make it happen this trip. Thanks to a swinger podcast, it motivated me to try tinder as a way to find someone in a new city. Tinder is way after my days of dating since I'm a married woman of many years but the husband said it would be a great idea and to give it a go. 

I figured out the app and started matching with guys. They would message me and after proposing what I was looking for, a couple were down, some seemed weirded out and others were simply not into it. (Which is totally cool.) I almost went with one guy (he was super nervous) until I received another message from a guy that was interested in me. Let's call him Jay. Jay seemed like he was down for a hook up so I just went right into what I wanted. No bullshit, no wasting my time. Once Jay responded that he was down, he was curious into seeing some more pics of us and of me. I wanted dick, and I wanted dick now. I cut to the chase after sending a couple pictures (he wanted a couple more) I told him before sending anymore he was either in or not. Like I said, I was on a mission and didn't want to waste any more time. He was IN! He agreed to meet, so I sent him our hotel address and room number.

The anticipation of waiting for him was exciting, nerve wrecking, and new. I asked my husband how I looked and he said I looked sexy.  I was wearing faded black high waisted shorts, a striped spaghetti strapped tank top with no bra underneath and a Calvin Klein thong. My husband could tell I was nervous. I knew I wanted this but I never fucked a complete stranger, so he just kissed up on me, and talked with me to keep me level headed which relaxed me. About 15-20 min. go by and I get a text from Jay saying he was outside and to open the door a bit so he knows which room to go to since it was late and it would be easier than looking for a room number. I kept thinking to myself, ok this is it. I'm usually a shy female and not very dominating but I knew that this was not only about him or my husband, it was about me as well and to just handle it. 

I opened the door a bit and waited what seemed like forever, Jay finally walked in. He looked like what he did in his picture. Tall, handsome, athletic built, dark brow hair and eyes. Just my type. I introduced myself first, and then introduced him to my husband. I could tell he had some nerves built up because he just flat out said, ""So, how are we doing this?"" I just smiled and asked him to sit down on the bed. Attempting to make him a bit comfortable with small talk, letting him know I preferred he use a condom etc. My husband was standing off to the side watching me talk with him, making sure I was making Jay feel comfortable which already started turning my husband on.  

Once Jay agreed, I had him lay down on the bed as I straddled myself on top of him and started to gently kiss and nibble his neck. I could tell he was into it because as I was doing that I was grinding on his cock which got hard very fast. The view my husband had was of my back facing him so he loved the slow grinding and the fact Jay was grabbing my ass and moving his hands with the movement of my hips was so hot. He began to kiss my neck.  I lifted my chest towards his lips and let my tank down where he helped lowered it some more and exposed my erected nipples. He tongued and sucked on my tits  and it felt amazing. (My nipples are very sensitive.) I started to make my way down to his stomach, slowly give him pecks which started to tease his cock. I know this, because he took his hand and slowly shoved my head towards his cock. I loved that he did that. Made me know he wanted my lips wrapped around his dick. We got his pants off and there his cock was. Rock fucking hard, 8.5 in length, thick and ready for me to take care of. I went straight for his balls and started to suck and lick them first as I was stroking his cock with my hand. Then wrapped my lips around his cock, and stroking it with my mouth. I sat up and started to unbutton my shorts and slipped them off. It exposed my thong and gave him a nice view of my ass as I continued to suck his dick. At this point my husband was seated on the bed next to us watching me do my thing. I knew he was so into it because there was a point where I had my lips around Jay's cock and I looked up at my husband with another man's cock in my mouth. The look in his eyes was so sexy and satisfying to me.  That let me know I was being a good little slut and I took that moment in for sure. 

Once I was ready for Jay's cock to be in my pussy, I looked up at Jay and asked him if he wanted to fuck me. Of course he replied with a yes, so I reached over towards the nightstand and grabbed a condom and put it on his cock. I took my tank top off. His cock was so hard, I knew he was going to fuck me up. I signaled my husband to come to me as I laid down in missionary position to get my pussy opened up. I had my head slightly hung over the bed where my husband took his pants off and shoved his cock in my mouth. As he was in my mouth, Jay slipped my thong to the side and slid his dick in my pussy. At that moment I let out a moan and felt every inch of both my holes being taken by both of these men. I fucking loved every second of it. This goes on for a few minutes, the guys communicate and get me to turn around where Jay is now fucking me doggy style and I still have my husband's cock in my mouth. There it was, in my head I was like holy shit. I'm being split roasted. (My husband later told me that view of me was AMAZING) I couldn't believe it and I loved every second of it. I wish we took a pic, but being in the moment, no one thought of their phones. There was a point where I had to turn around and tell Jay to go a bit slower because my pussy couldnt handle all the cock he was giving me. I'm a tiny lady, so Jay respected my wishes. It felt so good as he continued to slap my ass. Both of them at this point had an ass cheek. The feeling of being slapped, spread, grabbed, and fucked was so euphoric to me.  I loved all the attention I was getting. In my head I kept thinking, I'm so fucking lucky.

Before I knew it Jay said he was cumming and ripped the condom off. My husband told him to cum on my ass and that was so fucking hot to hear. My husband grabbed a towel cleaned me up and slipped my thong off while I cleaned Jay's dick up with my mouth. Jay is now laying down, cock still hard. I continue to suck Jay as my ass is up in the air where my husband takes my pussy hole and begins to fuck the shit out of me.

Many first happened here for all of us. First tinder hook up, first strange, first threesome, first split roast (which has been a fantasy for the longest). It's an experience I will never forget and now I crave more cock.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you read this, I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and warn you, it&amp;#39;s lengthy. So go ahead and grab a snack and enjoy reading my confession. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I went on vacation and have been wanting to try something new. We have had talks about doing a threesome (MMF) but it just never worked out. We were on a mission to make it happen this trip. Thanks to a swinger podcast, it motivated me to try tinder as a way to find someone in a new city. Tinder is way after my days of dating since I&amp;#39;m a married woman of many years but the husband said it would be a great idea and to give it a go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured out the app and started matching with guys. They would message me and after proposing what I was looking for, a couple were down, some seemed weirded out and others were simply not into it. (Which is totally cool.) I almost went with one guy (he was super nervous) until I received another message from a guy that was interested in me. Let&amp;#39;s call him Jay. Jay seemed like he was down for a hook up so I just went right into what I wanted. No bullshit, no wasting my time. Once Jay responded that he was down, he was curious into seeing some more pics of us and of me. I wanted dick, and I wanted dick now. I cut to the chase after sending a couple pictures (he wanted a couple more) I told him before sending anymore he was either in or not. Like I said, I was on a mission and didn&amp;#39;t want to waste any more time. He was IN! He agreed to meet, so I sent him our hotel address and room number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anticipation of waiting for him was exciting, nerve wrecking, and new. I asked my husband how I looked and he said I looked sexy.  I was wearing faded black high waisted shorts, a striped spaghetti strapped tank top with no bra underneath and a Calvin Klein thong. My husband could tell I was nervous. I knew I wanted this but I never fucked a complete stranger, so he just kissed up on me, and talked with me to keep me level headed which relaxed me. About 15-20 min. go by and I get a text from Jay saying he was outside and to open the door a bit so he knows which room to go to since it was late and it would be easier than looking for a room number. I kept thinking to myself, ok this is it. I&amp;#39;m usually a shy female and not very dominating but I knew that this was not only about him or my husband, it was about me as well and to just handle it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the door a bit and waited what seemed like forever, Jay finally walked in. He looked like what he did in his picture. Tall, handsome, athletic built, dark brow hair and eyes. Just my type. I introduced myself first, and then introduced him to my husband. I could tell he had some nerves built up because he just flat out said, &amp;quot;So, how are we doing this?&amp;quot; I just smiled and asked him to sit down on the bed. Attempting to make him a bit comfortable with small talk, letting him know I preferred he use a condom etc. My husband was standing off to the side watching me talk with him, making sure I was making Jay feel comfortable which already started turning my husband on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Jay agreed, I had him lay down on the bed as I straddled myself on top of him and started to gently kiss and nibble his neck. I could tell he was into it because as I was doing that I was grinding on his cock which got hard very fast. The view my husband had was of my back facing him so he loved the slow grinding and the fact Jay was grabbing my ass and moving his hands with the movement of my hips was so hot. He began to kiss my neck.  I lifted my chest towards his lips and let my tank down where he helped lowered it some more and exposed my erected nipples. He tongued and sucked on my tits  and it felt amazing. (My nipples are very sensitive.) I started to make my way down to his stomach, slowly give him pecks which started to tease his cock. I know this, because he took his hand and slowly shoved my head towards his cock. I loved that he did that. Made me know he wanted my lips wrapped around his dick. We got his pants off and there his cock was. Rock fucking hard, 8.5 in length, thick and ready for me to take care of. I went straight for his balls and started to suck and lick them first as I was stroking his cock with my hand. Then wrapped my lips around his cock, and stroking it with my mouth. I sat up and started to unbutton my shorts and slipped them off. It exposed my thong and gave him a nice view of my ass as I continued to suck his dick. At this point my husband was seated on the bed next to us watching me do my thing. I knew he was so into it because there was a point where I had my lips around Jay&amp;#39;s cock and I looked up at my husband with another man&amp;#39;s cock in my mouth. The look in his eyes was so sexy and satisfying to me.  That let me know I was being a good little slut and I took that moment in for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was ready for Jay&amp;#39;s cock to be in my pussy, I looked up at Jay and asked him if he wanted to fuck me. Of course he replied with a yes, so I reached over towards the nightstand and grabbed a condom and put it on his cock. I took my tank top off. His cock was so hard, I knew he was going to fuck me up. I signaled my husband to come to me as I laid down in missionary position to get my pussy opened up. I had my head slightly hung over the bed where my husband took his pants off and shoved his cock in my mouth. As he was in my mouth, Jay slipped my thong to the side and slid his dick in my pussy. At that moment I let out a moan and felt every inch of both my holes being taken by both of these men. I fucking loved every second of it. This goes on for a few minutes, the guys communicate and get me to turn around where Jay is now fucking me doggy style and I still have my husband&amp;#39;s cock in my mouth. There it was, in my head I was like holy shit. I&amp;#39;m being split roasted. (My husband later told me that view of me was AMAZING) I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it and I loved every second of it. I wish we took a pic, but being in the moment, no one thought of their phones. There was a point where I had to turn around and tell Jay to go a bit slower because my pussy couldnt handle all the cock he was giving me. I&amp;#39;m a tiny lady, so Jay respected my wishes. It felt so good as he continued to slap my ass. Both of them at this point had an ass cheek. The feeling of being slapped, spread, grabbed, and fucked was so euphoric to me.  I loved all the attention I was getting. In my head I kept thinking, I&amp;#39;m so fucking lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it Jay said he was cumming and ripped the condom off. My husband told him to cum on my ass and that was so fucking hot to hear. My husband grabbed a towel cleaned me up and slipped my thong off while I cleaned Jay&amp;#39;s dick up with my mouth. Jay is now laying down, cock still hard. I continue to suck Jay as my ass is up in the air where my husband takes my pussy hole and begins to fuck the shit out of me. He reaches over to shove my head down on Jay&amp;#39;s cock where I start to gag more and moan even louder. My husband wasnt ready to nut yet, so he stopped fucking me. I got on top of Jay&amp;#39;s cock and started to ride his dick shortly after feeling my ass getting slapped and before I knew it, I was back in the position of sucking Jay&amp;#39;s dick and my husband fucked me til he came, shoved my head down on Jay&amp;#39;s cock one more time til I got creampied.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

By changing specifically a long standing character who is white and/or male to make them a minority and/or female does not send a message of inclusion. Instead, the message being sent is that white people are done with the character, and now you can have their hand me downs.

&amp;#x200B;

By extension, I also greatly dislike token characters. Token characters are characters that are in a story where pretty much the sole reason they are there is to be a minority character. Southpark makes fun of this a lot with their character Token, who is the only black kid in Southpark. They are characters without substance, and only there for appeasement.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I like?

&amp;#x200B;

I like creating NEW stories. Not only new, but GOOD, well thought out stories, with solid characters in them who just so happen to be black/white/asian/male/female/cephalopod whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

The characters should be in their own story, not a hand me down remake of something else. Leave those universes to themselves. Create new universes instead. And NOT for the sake of creating them, either.

&amp;#x200B;

You create a story about a character who has to overcome their own challenges, or make a great personal sacrifice, in order to achieve their goal.

&amp;#x200B;

And she just happens to be black.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't touch upon it, you don't emphasis it, you don't make a big deal out of the character being female nor about her being black.

&amp;#x200B;

Because its normal.

&amp;#x200B;

You treat it as normal. It's expected. It does not matter at all.

&amp;#x200B;

By bringing attention to things like this, about changing an established character or by creating a token character, you are ensuring that the type of person you are trying to help and represent, in this case with the Little Mermaid being black women, are the 'other'. That they really don't belong. That they are being paid lip service. That you had to speciifcally take an existing white character and make her black for them, because only an originally white character can be good and you can't be bothered to create a good new original character and have them be black at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, create a character who happens to have those attributes. In a new story written with that character in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The same way you do every other story you write about where the character who is white.

&amp;#x200B;

But wait, you say, we don't go out and write stories about characters that emphases them being white, with the goal of displaying how great their whiteness is?

&amp;#x200B;

Exactly. We don't. If the story stars a white character, you just write a good fucking story. You don't pay attention to the character's race because it is an afterthought.

&amp;#x200B;

Do the same thing for your new character in your new story. Have them be whatever race or gender you want them to be that fits them into the story, then focus on making a good story and a good character, not that they are a black girl or an Asian boy, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

For example, CBS released a series called Star Trek: Discovery, which is now entering it's third season.

&amp;#x200B;

The main character of the series is Michael Burnham.

&amp;#x200B;

She is played by Sonequa Martin-Green, a black woman.

&amp;#x200B;

And through the entire series, at no point is it brought up that she is a woman, nor that she is black.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Why don't they bring up or make a point about how she is Black? Or a woman?

&amp;#x200B;

Because nobody cares. It does not matter. It's normal. They point out her race or gender just as often as they point out Captain Lorca's.

&amp;#x200B;

What? They don't point out how Lorca is a white male, you say?

&amp;#x200B;

Exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

I do take that back though. There is a character, Saru, who does point out Michael's race quite a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

What race is that?

&amp;#x200B;

Human.

&amp;#x200B;

That she is Human.

&amp;#x200B;

Because that's really all that matters here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dislike changing characters and their attributes when they are already established that is not point of normal plot progression.

This may be the wrong sub Reddit, but I figured I'd just confess my sins.
I cheated on my current girl not even a month in. It's unexcusable period, and I take full responsibility for my shitty actions, which resulted in me re thinking everything I've ever known about myself. 
I've never done such a thing in my life and idk why I would've done it. Perhaps I do. 
When I first met this girl I was maybe 5-6 months out of a 4 year relationship. 
The girl I was previously with messed with my heart and soul pretty good. Up and down, love, hate, more love, hate, love, etc. 
I'm a pretty down person and I don't know what's good or bad for me. either that or I'm just a fighter until the end. Once I give my heart away to someone I will fight through all the wickedness just to be with that person and that's unhealthy I know. 
Anyways, four years of complete fuckery. 
She finally ghosted me after she was sexually assaulted and I just had a hard time believing the truth was the truth for many reasons. I've actually previously posted about a couple months ago. Read if you want. 
Fast forward I met this girl at work and she was so sweet and caring and kind and I was really into her. 
Welllll my ex hit me up not even a month in and it just all came rushing back to me and confused me and what not. 
I ended up taking a Xanax one night never before have I taken it. But honestly it made me not think of my actions. Made me completely numb which idk if that's what it does but it did it to me. 
I know. One Xanax, really bro? Stupid. 
But I figured we were cool enough to talk so I went over and talked and smoked weed and it fucked me up. She invited me in and I was like sure IDGAF. I laid down, and she started getting close and I was like eehhhh wtf idk what to do, im so fucked up like it was no big deal to me. 
I hardly remember anything I feel like I fell asleep but I remember waking up next to her and feeling like OH FUCK.
I know I fucked up. I waited a day to tell my girlfriend what I did. I told her and it broke her heart that I cheated. Which broke my fucking heart but I thought about a future with her and like what it we exchanged vows one day? Lol but foreal what if? I couldn't live with that. 
I feel like telling her was a mistake because it ruined things with her and she was literally everything I ever wanted. 
Now we're both at a cross road, and she already slept with a co worker out of retaliation, which I can't be upset about anymore but still hurt. 
Her heart wants me but her head says no. 
She's right to feel that way, you know? 
But the feeling of what I did left me feeling terrible and like I sinned big time and locked myself out of heaven. 
I'll never ever do something so terrible to someone. 
She says she's confused and wishes someone would tell her what to do. 
If she takes a shot with me one last time I will give her everything I am. 
If she doesn't I accept that. 
But I'd love her with all my heart and soul. 
I made a mistake, but I was honest. 
I still don't know what to do. It's bigger than just me being a dumbass cheater. 
It's me figuring out myself, regardless. But I know if she gives me a chance I wouldn't let her down ever again. I'd give up alot to be with her. She's a wonderful woman.

It all started with Cody. I used to go over to Cody's house when I was 8. We did the normal 8 year old shit, chilled in his room and played toys. Then the sex started happening. I was never molested as a child, so I chalked it up to normal experimentation. For Cody, being the son of a single mom, I don't know. It all started with a simple pulling down of the pants exposing our penises, then pulling up again. It escalated slowly as we experimented. Pretty soon it was 1 or 2 seconds of touching, laughing, then pulling up. The furthest we got was laying down in his closet, placing our penises in eacthothers buttcracks for 30 seconds. One day his mom went out temporarily to the convenience store so we anxiously played our sex game as soon as she left. We had been daring eachother for awhile to try a blowjob, but both of us were too chicken. After a few minutes of standing in his closet, both our pants down, I worked up the courage to try, but just as I was about to, I heard his mom come in the main door and I told him to pull his pants up. I pulled mine up, but he didn't his. Then his mom came in the room, opened the closet door and freaked out upon seeing her 9yo son with an erect penis standing there. I got scared so I just left. Cody's mom most likely called my mom to tell her what happened. Cody and I hung out a few times afterwards but were closely watched by both our single moms. We wanted to continue the experimentation as it felt weird (but good), but there were no opportunities. Our moms would tell us to keep the doors open, etc. Cody then moved away and I never saw him again.

&amp;#x200B;

But I wanted to continue the experimentation. I didn't understand sex, but I already knew it was powerful and pleasurable. For years afterwards the experimentation continued with other friends I had. Most notably was a perfect storm of circumstances with my friend Shawn. He was my neighbor in my apartment building. That combined with my single mom's gambling addiction meant that from age 10 onward, my mom would be gone 3-4 nights a week for 3 hours at a time, leaving me alone at the house. Shawn &amp; I did the normal friendship stuff you'd expect at that age, but we also played doctor regularly. This is where the sexualization was enhanced the most. We would take turns being the patient/doctor. The doctor would come in and pretend to scan the patients body. THe doctor would then ask the patient what his symptoms were, and I shit you not, the answer would always be ""dink, ass, and nipples"". It was merely a pretext to get to the sex. Over the years we did it all, and to this day I still look back on it fondly, as 8-15 years of age were my most sexually active in my life. Handjobs, blowjobs, rimjobs, assfucking, 69'ing. One time shawn said he had to piss, but I kept giving him a blowjob anyways and he pissed in my mouth. After awhile we became comfortable with cumming in eachothers mouths during a blowjob despite cum grossing us out, I think we chased the pleasure of blowing in a mouth. I had a few other boy lovers around that age, but nothing that was permanent or as far as Shawn &amp; I got. I know Shawn to this day and we're still friends. We sporadically had non-penetrative gay sex from ages 15-26, maybe once a year or two, when both of us were without girlfriends or regular action.

&amp;#x200B;

It disturbs me to admit that when I think back about all the sexual activity with cody &amp; shawn, I get turned on. It makes me wish I could go back to those moments. Now today, I do not consider myself gay. I do not find men attractive, however I do find extremely feminine transgender (men/women whatever) attractive, but the transgender person has to be top tier, waxed body and as small a penis as possible. I am aware the level of sexualization I experienced so young is not typical of a childhood, and I've always wondered how it manifests itself in my adult life (whether positively or negatively).

1.  I hate my husband.
2. I know I should leave him
3. I have sought counseling

First things first. He was physically abusive at least 3 or four times. Instead of leaving him the first time like I should have, I just made him swear to me that he would change and stop. After anger management and only a few sessions of therapy he ""seems"" to think he is okay and the problem is me because , I am emotionally unstable and cause all of the problems.  There is a lot of back and forth. Sometimes I do get really emotionally overwhelmed and there have been occasions where I have cried myself to sleep for several days because of the tone he took with me, the mass amount of expletives he chooses to use to label me and make me feel like a shitty person. He is always telling me I am the victim, and play games with him because he thinks I know exactly what he expects and wants. So yes he no longer physically attacks me but he will often call me a bitch, a hoe, a broke-ass, he will say things like didn't you go to college or arent you supposed to be smart etc. My therapist has declared him immutable (he will not change) and he operates from a narrowly defined point of view. A few years ago, before I graduated, he told me I was not as smart as I think for whatever reason, after declaring that I had an interest in attending medical school. Furthermore he tends to berate me for not being financially responsible, but then often the consequence of his decisions when he is upset with me puts me in a position to spend money. There are a few examples of this. He is a very impatient person. I was working a retail job and when I would tell him what time i was off, he would be there at that exact time. If i was more than 2 min late he would be very annoyed and we would fight. We had multiple arguments about this. I explained to him that often things would happen last minute and I couldnt always necessarily leave at said time because in retail thats the time the shift actually ends. The resolution for this situation was that I would tell him to come 15 minutes after the time i got off but he said I should have told him that from the start. However true that may be, I feel that I never would have know to do that if we didnt have so any fights about it. We are all creatures of habit and I had never had to modify times like that for anyone else in my life. The other ""consequence"" of my ""lying"" as he would call my being late, would be him leaving. I understood him leaving as I would need to find my own way home. Then one day, it was pretty frigid out, I was tired. I told him I was going to have a friend take me home within the next two hours. He said no. Thats not what I said to do. I said why is it a problem. He said youre supposed to take the bus home. I said to him, I just missed the bus and that it was cold outside so I was going to uber. He said no to that too. I asked him if he expects for me to be cold while waiting for the bus. He said you wont freeze because 60 something is not that cold. Yet, I am ALWAYS cold. I always have been. He said I would only be uncomfortable for about 10-15 minutes and to just suck it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I did call the police on him 2 times and I feel like that must be fueling his anger. His friend had to post bail and he pays fees monthly . To give some context. The first time i did was a whole scene. We lived with a family at the time. The mother was a recovering alcoholic and her son lived with her and so did two other random people. She was renting to save money. I come home from work one day (walking) because his punishment is to not pick me up from work which I had asked that day. I was approaching the sidewalk of the house and saw him. He said something to me, I dont know what he said but he grabbed me by the hood of my jacket which had my hair in it. I told him to stop and then he threw his beer at me. The son witnessed this and then came to pull him off. They started fighting. Throwing punches biting, choking, etc. I went into the sons room because he told me to go there for safety and I started crying. Mind you, I was extremely exhausted. The night before my bf got locked out of her place and needed to stay with me. I had work at 6 am and got off at 2 so my mental strength was not all that great. I called the cops I was super scared. I was raised in a completely different environment. To me that was too much. I was crying to them when they came and they basically took him to jail. after talking to me and the guy. He blamed me for him going to jail. 

The second time, I called the police indirectly i suppose. I was having a mental break-down because of him taking my phone and my computer from me after a fight we had because he said that he paid for them. I was in the room and panicking so I asked my housemates for their phone to call the domestic abuse people to come get me so i could feel safe.  They asked me if anything physical had transpired and I said no. I was clear about that. I just told them I didnt feel safe, which was 100% true based on his previous history. They came and took him to jail again, his birthday was the next day. His cousin was visiting him. The took him because he violated his probation. He was not supposed to be drinking. An then a no MATH order was in place.

In case you are wondering why I was so upset and scared and unstable...There was a night, several months after i left. I told him I was not going to come back home that night because I wanted to study at school. He said no. I tried to get him to understand why. I explained that I needed to focus and what not. He told me if I was going to stay there not to come back. I didnt feel like having anymore back and forth, so I just stayed to continue studying and text/call him. The next day after school., I came back to pack a few clothes because I didnt really want to have an encounter with him. He came home while i was doing this and he was basically like leave, blah bah started flipping the mattress, pulled the sheets off the bed, started ripping my clothes, my jacket. Forced me onto the floor, hit me, kicked me. The whole time I thought I would die, I just remained curled up and eventually I fought my way out to leave the house. I ended up staying in the sons room for the first time that night and he locked the door and kept me safe. I didnt realize it at the time but he risked a lot to help me as well since he had too had some legal issues he was dealing with. I told my now husband that I was going to leave him twice, he told me he needed me like the cliche you hear about. I fell for it. I have myself to blame for it because i should have just believed that some people dont change. He claims he is a good husband because he pays for things for me. Thats all he has become to me now. At this point I dont love him anymore. I just pretend to in order to keep the peace. I struggle with depression and anxiety which doesnt help and I often fantasize about torturing him the way he has tormented me. Mostly I just want someone else to. At the end of the day I believe that karma will catch up to him. Especially because he is a coach at a division 1 school. So many times I have thought about telling his coworkers and friends about the facade he presents. The worst part about all of it is his parents know everything and for whatever reason they think I am the problem because I dont do what a wife is ""supposed"" to do which is be ""submissive"" to her husband. In all honesty I think my husband is a dumbass. He doesnt know shit but wants to me listen to what he says because he 1) makes more money 2) pays for things 3) is the husband. 

Ask and I'll answer. If you honestly think Im playing the ""victim"" card please tell me because at this point its hard to tell what I may have been brainwashed into thinking or what is reality and what I tell myself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I figure this sub will be come somewhat of a permanent residence for me. I just need to air out a lifetimes worth of dirty laundry that I&amp;#39;ve that ive been compartmentalizing for far too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I hate my husband.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know I should leave him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have sought counseling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first. He was physically abusive at least 3 or four times. Instead of leaving him the first time like I should have, I just made him swear to me that he would change and stop. After anger management and only a few sessions of therapy he &amp;quot;seems&amp;quot; to think he is okay and the problem is me because , I am emotionally unstable and cause all of the problems.  There is a lot of back and forth. Sometimes I do get really emotionally overwhelmed and there have been occasions where I have cried myself to sleep for several days because of the tone he took with me, the mass amount of expletives he chooses to use to label me and make me feel like a shitty person.

&amp;#x200B;

From my burner account.

I have a new dirty secret..

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** So I've been on and off most dating apps for the past 4-5 years or so and I've matched a pretty mixed bag of women.

They usually fall into 1 of 2 cases though:

1.)  Regardless of how good our chemistry is, after a few platonic meet ups or a long running conversation we always end up fizzling out. We become distant Instagram friends, with the occasional ""like"" of each others post - This is how a majority of my matches end.

2.) The very very very small minority would result in us flirting and sexting. - Regardless of reasoning, I ended up liking this case way more for obvious reasons, lol. **I WILL SAY THIS, It felt nice having someone SOLICIT some kind of nude, and it felt nice to be able to deliver.**

&amp;#x200B;

Long story long I wanted to increase my odds of case 2, so I scrapped my old account and made a new one with a simple Profile Picture - An Eggplant emoji with a black background and a message that is reflected in my bio. ""DM me ""x"" to give consent for me to send pics... This isn't highschool. Unsolicited Pics are lame af!!!"" no ask for sexts in return.

&amp;#x200B;

A truly desperate attempt to sext with strangers freely would probably end in very little matches and much more people looking to troll. But to my surprise.. Matches begin to come in. Actually, they came in offensively faster than they ever would on my actual account, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem:** Almost immediately, a girl that I matched with on my old account matched with this new one. I didn't recognize her profile set up, but i immediately remembered her IG profile when she sent it. Our previous match didn't get by roughly 5 msgs.

&amp;#x200B;

 However, She sent me a message simply containing the letter X. She gave me her IG account to send to and I did...

&amp;#x200B;

This, i'm willing to let slide because although i matched with her before, i don't really know her. BUT, I didn't stop to think that someone I know will match with this account... That begins to feel like an invasion of privacy that i'm not comfortable with AT ALL!

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in the bathroom, a partner came saying that the proffesor was very worried about me. Even though it was a bit exaggerated for a simple cut, I was moved that he had worried about me. I went back to the classroom and the prof applied alcohol to clean wound and put me a Band-Aid. This got me destroyed me emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

(Suddenly I thought on my father. When I was little he was very hard with me; when I was sick he just wanted me to not bother him, he always said that ""men shouldn't cry"" and I remember that once I was crying because I broke a mirror and it almost fell on me, he shouted at me saying that I must ""squeeze my balls own"" to remember I'm man and stop being a girl. He also was alcoholic, and I never really spent time with him, didn't even do the singlest dad &amp; son activity with him).

&amp;#x200B;

I felt it was the first time someone really cared about me, which moved me a lot. It was incredible that the prof ran to bring alcohol and a Band-Aid for me. What moved me the most is that he took my finger, cleaned my wound, and put me the Band-Aid all by himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, the recess started. I pretended to be on my cell phone but in reality, I just wanted to get away from everyone and cry. When the recess ended and I returned to the classroom, I tried not to think about the subject until the class ends, so I acted normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we had a cut of the day (which is a period of 1 hour where everyone can go or stay of the establishment). Only two classmates stayed in the classroom and started playing poker. When I arrived in the classroom, the first thing I did was sit in the back and start crying, I really could not hold it any longer. I did not want to cry, I hate it, but I couldn't do anything else than that. In that moment I hated myself for being that sensitive. I did not know if I was happy or sad, nor why I was really crying, maybe the scars of the past opened, or maybe I was incredibly moved. I didn't feel this way since I was a kid.

&amp;#x200B;

My classmates (the two that were playing poker) asked me if I was ok, to which I did not even respond. I do not know if they realized I was crying.

&amp;#x200B;

I (21M) have been thinking back to how I used to act when I was an young teen (12-13 yrs) and feel absolutely disgusted with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the spectrum, so I used to be very gullible and easily led on, but I also didn't have a filter like I should've done. I used to hang about with girls thinking they liked me when they were clearly just making fun of me. I was waay too eager to talk about sex and porn and the like; pretending I was more aware and mature than I was and regularly making people uncomfortable. I was talked into doing some *very* humiliating things and constantly made a complete arse of myself. I was also just an annoying little shit in general, never knowing when enough was enough, to take no for an answer, and to just stop.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone wants specifics I can talk in private, but I don't feel comfortable doing that here.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I grew out of this phase I did my best to just suppress and deny it all. Recently its all come back up in my head to haunt me. I've turned my life around and i'm not sleepwalking it anymore. I'm in a serious relationship, am more introverted and self aware and have a circle of close friends; I like to think i'm a more mature, level-headed and better man now. I want to just move on from it all but I have a panic attack whenever I think about it and if somebody confronted me about it all, just wanting to just throw myself off a bridge or run away to a 3rd world country or something.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account.&lt;/p&gt;

It just strengthened my already preconceived notions about black homophobia. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, i know that stereotyping is wrong--especially being a member of the LGBT+ community. However I just can't shake these feelings. Everywhere i go that has a concentration of black men: Whether it be Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and even real life, I see such outward and vitriolic homophobia--the kind that would be unanimously condemned in any other space--expressed with virtually no contest, no condemnation, and no remorse. When I see stories of transgender people getting killed/assaulted, it's always black men misgendering the victim and saying shit like ""oh they deserved it"" and making jokes out of it. It disgusts me.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a cultural thing, i bet. Toxic Masculinity is a scourge upon the Black Community. There's such an emphasis on black men from other black men to be ""hard"", ""manly"", and controlling. Anything else is seen as emasculation. I was recently looking at a twitter thread from NBA about NBA player Jabari Parker at NYC pride and the replies were filled with black men decrying this as the ""emasculation of black men"" and accused the NBA of spreading the ""Gay Agenda"". People who called them out were met with ridicule and found no support. Combine this toxic masculinity with the fact that the black community is the most religious community in the country, and you get this intense scrutiny and othering of LGBT black men. We're not viewed as fellow black men. We're ""different"". And I guess that's true. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't straight up avoid black men. I'd be happy to have more black male friends, but i'm always weary of being myself around them.  I already don't act very stereotypically gay and flamboyant, because that's just not my personality, but still I always find myself pressured to act even more masculine, tough, and ""hard"" around them. It feels like these days i can only be friends with and be myself around white girls, black girls, and other LGBT+ people (Because honestly the white boys around here aren't too hot on LGBT issues themselves, although they are better than the black boys').

&amp;#x200B;

I don't hate black men. I'm just really annoyed by them. Because at the end of the day, gay black men *are still black men.* We have to uplift and support straight black men and fight their battles with them on black issues despite alot of them hating our guts, i just wish they'd show us the same support, is all.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 16 year old bisexual boy, and in my experience, there&amp;#39;s no group of people more homophobic/transphobic than black men. Black &lt;em&gt;women&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, are some of the most accepting people in my expeience, alongside white women. It&amp;#39;s why around 95% of my friends are black and white girls, the other 5% being white boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m friendly with a couple of black ppl in my school, but i would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; come out to them.

&lt;p&gt;I begged and cried and wanted her back. Cause it’s your first love and you don’t think you will move on from that. She then proceeded to send me texts on how she is sleeping with that male friend and they are in a relationship. Told me “time to rub it in your face”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t seem to wonder how I messed it up. Made her probably even think I was in contact with exes.&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies for that, but this is very hard for me and I have been carrying it for a lot of years. On the advice of my therapist, I’ve written it all out to try to work out my feelings on it. He didn’t advise me to submit it to Reddit of course, but I have struggled with this for a long time, and I need to hear other people’s opinion on it. I still really have no idea how I feel about it, even after all these years, but I will submit for judgment by the masses. I know I did wrong on some things, probably a lot of things. I tried to do my best that I could.

My son was very troubled. VERY troubled. If you have seen the movie ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"", it will really help to understand what I'm talking about, because I swear to God when I watched that film I thought I was watching a documentary of my life, I felt like the writer must have had cameras hidden in my damn house, that’s how accurate it was. The only difference is that in the movie, the boy appears normal to his father and only reveals his true nature to his mother, with my son he didn’t have that mask. His insane behavior was the same with everyone.

From the day he was born, my son just came out wrong. He was planned, my wife and I tried to get pregnant and were ecstatic when he was born. He was wanted and loved. We showered affection on him and really tried to give him a happy childhood. But from the day we brought him home from the hospital, he was miserable. He cried for 13 months straight. I’m not exaggerating, 13 months without a break, he cried until he had no voice left and kept crying, you could see his little face scrunched up and no sound coming out, totally hoarse. There were times he would literally be crying in his sleep, I’ve never seen or heard of any other kid able to do that. We brought him to doctors, specialists, tried changing his diet, held him, rocked him, toys, swaddling, music, mobiles, everything we could think of. Nothing worked. 13 months of grating, grinding, no sleep hell.

Once he got over the crying stage, we thought we were out of the woods. But it quickly became clear that for some unknown reason, he was just angry at being alive. I never saw that kid have a genuine, joyous smile once in the time I knew him. I saw him grin a vicious, horrible grin many times, taking a perverse pleasure from causing pain or suffering or breaking a rule, but a smile from real pleasure at something nice? No, never. Not once. He had no interest in anything positive; he was fueled by hate, and everything he did was bent toward that.

As soon as he could walk, his mission in life was to destroy things. He would break or try to break anything that came in his range, smash it, chew it, throw it in the toilet, whatever he could. After a while he figured out how to get his diaper off and took great pleasure in shitting and pissing anywhere he could. After a while he figured out he could hide it, and started pissing and shitting in places we wouldn’t find right away, grinding it into carpets making it even more of a problem to clean and making the house stink. When he got older, (ages 9-15) he would piss and shit in our bed, until we got a lock on our door and he wasn’t able to get in anymore; then he’d just take a dump in the hallway in front of our room. That biological warfare started around a 2 and a half years old and he never grew out of it.

I’ll try to speed it up as I could literally go on for days about this stuff, but as he grew older, he became more and more unmanageable. He would bite, kick, scream, scratch and spit at anyone trying to do anything with him. He was kicked out of school twice before he was 9, then let him back in and then kicked him out for good, he had to change schools. The next one put him in a special class that kept him away from the other students. We had to install a door and lock on the kitchen because he would steal knives and use them to gouge the walls/furniture or chase people with them. When he was 10, he stabbed me pretty good in the hip and ass, I still have the scars. As he grew older, he grew darker. He moved into setting things on fire, and torturing local animals. There was a stray dog that hung out around the park near our house, my son blinded it in one eye with a BBQ fork. He would dip cat’s tails in gasoline and light them on fire. He became a violent, stinking, vicious beast that lived in our house. We couldn’t do anything with him.

I will take this opportunity to preempt the tsunami of messages: YES, we had the kid in fucking therapy. He saw a psychiatrist twice a week, and had god knows how many different medications prescribed to him over the years. Nothing worked. Therapy didn’t work. Meds didn’t work. Nothing fucking worked. He was like a poison cloud of hate and fury lashing out at anything in his reach.

When my son was 16, my wife got pregnant again. I can’t tell you how different our reaction was. Instead of joy, we felt horror. This pregnancy had not been planned, and we really were at a loss over what to do. My son had been such an unending nightmare for 16 years, we couldn’t take the idea of starting again from the beginning. We talked a lot about terminating, but a) access to abortion was not as easy in those days as it is now, and b) my wife was very against it. We talked about many options. In the end, we decided that my wife would have the baby, and if it turned out evil we would put it up for adoption. We knew we just couldn’t do it again with another child like our son.

We had a daughter. She was normal. Suddenly we saw what our lives should have been like the whole time, how things would have been had our son not been himself. She laughed at things. She breast fed without biting (she didn’t have teeth yet anyway, but you could tell she was just trying to eat, not tear her mom’s breast off). After 4 months she was sleeping through the night. She was happy. She was NORMAL. I can’t describe the relief and happiness that we both felt, I don’t have the words for it.

This where I believe I may have started really pulling back from my son. Up until that time, whatever mistakes I made, I had always tried to do the best for my son, I am convinced of that. I tried to help him and love him and care for him, I really tried. But when my daughter was born, my wife and I both instinctively just turned toward her. She became our focus, not from malice, but just because she was so much EASIER. She was so happy and sweet, every moment we were with her was like magic. I understand this was wrong, but we honestly couldn’t help it. I don’t have a better explanation than that.

My son hadn’t given a shit about my wife being pregnant, I honestly don’t know if he really understood it, but when we brought our daughter home he started acting out even more. I didn’t think it was possible, but he took it up another notch. At this time he was 17, and we were having blow-out screaming matches daily. Usually after we fought, he would storm out of the house and disappear for hours at a time, or come back the next morning. It was a relief. I started to actually look forward to our fights because it would get him away from us for a while.

After the birth of our daughter, my relationship with my son was almost entirely gone, our only real interactions were screaming at each other. My wife was even worse with him, she just had nothing left. By that time, if our son even came in to the same room as her, she would just stop whatever she was doing and start screaming “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY! GET THE FUCK OUT!” until he left. He started spending more and more time out of the house, which was a blessing for us. I have no idea what he got up to out in the world, but we were just happy it wasn’t being inflicted on us.

As a consequence of our son’s behavior, we had invested heavily in locks around our house. All of the cheap, thin interior doors in our home had been replaced with think, dense wood doors that couldn’t be kicked through, equipped with keyed locks that my wife and I carried keys to. I know it sounds extreme, but locks and heavy doors were the best way we had found to create safe spaces from him. And again, before I am inundated with messages, I was not locking my son in rooms like a prisoner, he had free reign of the house and could come and go as he pleased. My wife and I would lock OURSELVES in rooms to protect ourselves from him, if anything WE were the prisoners in our own home.

On the day in question, I had fought with my son in the morning and he had left the house in a rage. My wife and I were enjoying some peace and quiet in the kitchen while our daughter napped in our bedroom. And then my daughter began crying. Any parent who has young children can tell you, you get used to your child’s cries and you can tell after a while what they need, they cry differently if they are hungry, or need changing, or are just restless and want to be held. Babies can communicate pretty well before they can speak. This cry was none of those things. This cry was terror. The second we heard it my wife and I were both up out of our chairs and running to the room. The door was locked of course, and it took a few seconds to get the right key and get it open.

My son was in the room. We lived in a bungalow, and the bastard had climbed in the window to get to her. He was standing over her crib with a steak knife in his hand. I have no idea where he got it, it wasn’t one of ours; we controlled our knives very carefully and always kept them in locked drawers. I think he may have stolen it from one of our neighbor’s houses. He had broken her skin twice already, once in the belly area and once on her arm. I could see blood running down. When I entered the room he was dragging the back of the knife down her face, not cutting, almost tickling her with it, teasing her while she screamed. He looked up at us and smiled.

Before I knew what I was doing, I was already moving, running to put myself between them. I didn’t think about it, I just moved instinctively. Even with that, my wife got there faster, it was like a movie on fast forward, she got to our son and bashed his hand away, knocking the knife across the room and then shoved him with her whole body weight, so hard that he flew away from the crib and bounced off the wall. I picked up my daughter and held her while my wife screened us. I could see her shaking, almost convulsing. I can remember the smell of the room, the sound of my daughter screaming and wailing. The look on my son’s face as he stood there. Just nothing. Blank, dead, there was nothing in his eyes, no emotion. He looked like an alien to me. I watched my wife take a step toward him. I could have reached out and stopped her, but I didn’t. She stepped forward again, very close to him. I could have stopped her again. But I didn’t. She waited, looking at him for maybe 3 to 5 seconds without moving. And then she punched him in the face.

Now until this point, you may have been picturing my wife as a typical woman, small frame, dainty, delicate. This is not the case. My wife does have a small frame, but dainty and delicate she is not, never has been since I’ve known her. Since her early teens, my wife has been a boxer. MMA didn’t exist back then, but karate and boxing were big in those days, and my wife was a VERY talented amateur. She was about 130 pounds, she carried a lot of muscle and she knew how to punch. I had 70 pounds on her back then, and I have no doubt that in a real fight between me and her she could have and would have pounded me flat. Neither of us had ever laid a hand on our son in anger before, but something broke in her that day, and all the years of anger and pain and sorrow and frustration just came pouring out. When she hit him his head snapped back and blood started pouring out of his nose. He hardly reacted, he just looked at her with this shocked expression like he didn’t know how to process what had just happened. She waited another second. And then she hit him again.

I could have reached out and stopped her. I could have dragged her out of the room, taken her away, calmed her. I didn’t. I just stood there and watched while she systematically started to pound him to a pulp. Every time he brought his hands to cover one part she would blast him somewhere else, body, head, body, head, over and over. He started screaming, crying out, yelling for her to stop. It’s the most genuine reaction I’d ever seen him have to anything in his whole life. But she wasn’t stopping. I watched her ramping up, hitting harder, faster, working him like a heavy bag. He tried to swing at her and she slipped him easily. She was on auto pilot, sinking down into her training. I stood there watching for a minute. Then I turned my back on them and took my daughter out of the room.

I brought my daughter to the kitchen and gave her a bath in the sink. I found that he had cut her a third time on the sole of her foot. All the cuts were superficial. I cleaned her up and held her until she calmed. I put Polysporin and Band-Aids on her cuts. In our bedroom, I could hear my son screaming, calling my wife horrible names, telling her he would cut her head off and fuck her corpse. After a while, I didn’t hear him saying anything anymore, didn’t even hear him crying out. I assumed that he must have been knocked out. But I could still hear her beating him.

That went on for a long time. Long enough for my daughter to drift off to sleep in my arms. I just sat at the kitchen table waiting for her to finish. Finally she came out and sat down across from me. Her hands were swollen and red. Her face and arms were splattered with blood. Her chest was heaving. We just stared at each other without saying anything. After a while I asked her “Is he dead?” She looked back at me and answered “I fucking hope so”. I nodded. That was all there was to say about that. I understood how she felt perfectly. I felt the same. I didn’t know what to do, so we just sat there waiting silently. Eventually my wife started crying and went to go take a shower. I just stayed where I was holding our daughter.

After a long while, I heard moaning and sobbing coming from our room. It turned out that my son wasn’t dead. I went in to see how bad it was, and it was… pretty bad. I’ve never seen a more merciless beating laid onto anyone, before or since. He was lying on the floor, rolling around with blood leaking out of his face, lying in a pool of vomit. His nose was squashed flat out across his face, both of his eyes were completely swollen shut and starting to blacken already. I could see that a couple of his fingers were bent out at weird angles and he had pissed his pants. I think he must have been missing teeth, but I couldn’t see any on the floor and I couldn't see inside his mouth, his lips were all puffed up and swollen. From talking to my wife about it later, I know now that she had systematically beaten every part of his body, focusing heavily on his legs. She told me she kicked him in the groin repeatedly until her legs got tired, and had kept beating his body long after he had passed out.

When my wife came out of the shower, I still didn’t know what to do about our son. I didn’t know whether to call the police or an ambulance, take him to the hospital myself, I honestly didn’t have any idea what to do. After a while I realized that I simply didn’t care what happened to him anymore, and we decided to just let him live or die on his own. There was an in-law suite in the basement that we had never really used, and my wife, my daughter and I just moved down there. We simply ceded the top floor of the house to my son and locked everything down, separated our lives entirely. There was plenty of food in the upstairs cabinets, enough for a couple weeks or more, he had a washroom and bedrooms to use. We had a washroom in the basement, a small kitchenette, and a separate entrance so we just stopped going upstairs. We just decided we were done with him. I figured we'd let his food run out and see what happened.

Over the next week we could hear him moving around upstairs sometimes. I think he just spent most of time lying in bed recovering. I went to work, watching on high alert in case he attacked me in the driveway, but he never did. My wife stayed home with our daughter. She was never out of our sight. One night we heard him going ballistic, smashing things and banging. We didn’t respond. He never tried to get downstairs or get near us though. I think he was afraid that if he got near us again, my wife might finish the job on him. After three weeks down in the basement, we hadn’t heard anything from up above for a few days, and I ventured upstairs to the main floor of the house.

The place was demolished, and there was no sign of my son. He was gone. It took months to repair the damage he had done and get the main floor back to normal again. There was food and shit smeared all over the walls and broken glass on the floor, big holes in the dry wall, he had ripped the place apart. He tore up the linoleum in a corner of the kitchen and emptied an entire foam fire extinguisher into the living room. I feel thankful that he didn't burn the house down with us in it, I'm honestly not sure why he didn't, the kid wasn't shy about lighting things on fire. After that, I lived in fear every day that he would come back, that he would ambush us out of the blue and try to kill us. We moved house about 3 years later and I finally stopped being afraid that he would show up again, as now he had no idea where we were. I finally felt safe from him.

All this happened a long time ago. My son was born in the spring of 1971, my daughter was born in ’88. I'm an old man now, I’ll be 70 this year and my wife passed from cancer in 2016. My daughter is 31 now, I moved in with her and her husband after my wife passed. I’ve got two granddaughters and they are the joy of my life. I see a therapist a couple times a month to talk about all this. I don’t know where my son is. The last time I saw him was when he was lying on the floor of our bedroom, bleeding and smashed. I haven’t heard from him since he left, more than 30 years now. I don’t want to.

I carry a lot of guilt from that time, and a lot of conflicted emotions. I didn’t beat him myself, but I allowed him to be beaten, and I thought he deserved it. I was happy it happened. I didn’t try to kill him, but I would have been happy if he died. I will say that I do hope he was able to overcome his demons and go live a normal life somewhere. If he wasn’t able to do that, if he stayed the way he was, then I truly do hope someone out there killed him. When I knew him he was a rabid dog, and whichever way it went I just hope he isn’t still out there hurting anyone else.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, fair warning, this one is long as hell. Apologies for that, but this is very hard for me and I have been carrying it for a lot of years. On the advice of my therapist, I’ve written it all out to try to work out my feelings on it. He didn’t advise me to submit it to Reddit of course, but I have struggled with this for a long time, and I need to hear other people’s opinion on it. I still really have no idea how I feel about it, even after all these years, but I will submit for judgment by the masses. I know I did wrong on some things, probably a lot of things. I tried to do my best that I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son was very troubled. VERY troubled. If you have seen the movie &amp;quot;We Need To Talk About Kevin&amp;quot;, it will really help to understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about, because I swear to God when I watched that film I thought I was watching a documentary of my life, I felt like the writer must have had cameras hidden in my damn house, that’s how accurate it was. The only difference is that in the movie, the boy appears normal to his father and only reveals his true nature to his mother, with my son he didn’t have that mask. His insane behavior was the same with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the day he was born, my son just came out wrong. He was planned, my wife and I tried to get pregnant and were ecstatic when he was born. He was wanted and loved. We showered affection on him and really tried to give him a happy childhood. But from the day we brought him home from the hospital, he was miserable. He cried for 13 months straight. I’m not exaggerating, 13 months without a break, he cried until he had no voice left and kept crying, you could see his little face scrunched up and no sound coming out, totally hoarse. There were times he would literally be crying in his sleep, I’ve never seen or heard of any other kid able to do that. We brought him to doctors, specialists, tried changing his diet, held him, rocked him, toys, swaddling, music, mobiles, everything we could think of. Nothing worked. 13 months of grating, grinding, no sleep hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he got over the crying stage, we thought we were out of the woods. But it quickly became clear that for some unknown reason, he was just angry at being alive. I never saw that kid have a genuine, joyous smile once in the time I knew him. I saw him grin a vicious, horrible grin many times, taking a perverse pleasure from causing pain or suffering or breaking a rule, but a smile from real pleasure at something nice? No, never. Not once. He had no interest in anything positive; he was fueled by hate, and everything he did was bent toward that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as he could walk, his mission in life was to destroy things. He would break or try to break anything that came in his range, smash it, chew it, throw it in the toilet, whatever he could. After a while he figured out how to get his diaper off and took great pleasure in shitting and pissing anywhere he could. After a while he figured out he could hide it, and started pissing and shitting in places we wouldn’t find right away, grinding it into carpets making it even more of a problem to clean and making the house stink. When he got older, (ages 9-15) he would piss and shit in our bed, until we got a lock on our door and he wasn’t able to get in anymore; then he’d just take a dump in the hallway in front of our room. That biological warfare started around a 2 and a half years old and he never grew out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to speed it up as I could literally go on for days about this stuff, but as he grew older, he became more and more unmanageable. He would bite, kick, scream, scratch and spit at anyone trying to do anything with him. He was kicked out of school twice before he was 9, then let him back in and then kicked him out for good, he had to change schools. The next one put him in a special class that kept him away from the other students. We had to install a door and lock on the kitchen because he would steal knives and use them to gouge the walls/furniture or chase people with them. When he was 10, he stabbed me pretty good in the hip and ass, I still have the scars. As he grew older, he grew darker. He moved into setting things on fire, and torturing local animals. There was a stray dog that hung out around the park near our house, my son blinded it in one eye with a BBQ fork. He would dip cat’s tails in gasoline and light them on fire. He became a violent, stinking, vicious beast that lived in our house. We couldn’t do anything with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will take this opportunity to preempt the tsunami of messages: YES, we had the kid in fucking therapy. He saw a psychiatrist twice a week, and had god knows how many different medications prescribed to him over the years. Nothing worked. Therapy didn’t work. Meds didn’t work. Nothing fucking worked. He was like a poison cloud of hate and fury lashing out at anything in his reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my son was 16, my wife got pregnant again. I can’t tell you how different our reaction was. Instead of joy, we felt horror. This pregnancy had not been planned, and we really were at a loss over what to do. My son had been such an unending nightmare for 16 years, we couldn’t take the idea of starting again from the beginning. We talked a lot about terminating, but a) access to abortion was not as easy in those days as it is now, and b) my wife was very against it. We talked about many options. In the end, we decided that my wife would have the baby, and if it turned out evil we would put it up for adoption. We knew we just couldn’t do it again with another child like our son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a daughter. She was normal. Suddenly we saw what our lives should have been like the whole time, how things would have been had our son not been himself. She laughed at things. She breast fed without biting (she didn’t have teeth yet anyway, but you could tell she was just trying to eat, not tear her mom’s breast off). After 4 months she was sleeping through the night. She was happy. She was NORMAL. I can’t describe the relief and happiness that we both felt, I don’t have the words for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This where I believe I may have started really pulling back from my son. Up until that time, whatever mistakes I made, I had always tried to do the best for my son, I am convinced of that. I tried to help him and love him and care for him, I really tried. But when my daughter was born, my wife and I both instinctively just turned toward her. She became our focus, not from malice, but just because she was so much EASIER. She was so happy and sweet, every moment we were with her was like magic. I understand this was wrong, but we honestly couldn’t help it. I don’t have a better explanation than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son hadn’t given a shit about my wife being pregnant, I honestly don’t know if he really understood it, but when we brought our daughter home he started acting out even more. I didn’t think it was possible, but he took it up another notch. At this time he was 17, and we were having blow-out screaming matches daily. Usually after we fought, he would storm out of the house and disappear for hours at a time, or come back the next morning. It was a relief. I started to actually look forward to our fights because it would get him away from us for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the birth of our daughter, my relationship with my son was almost entirely gone, our only real interactions were screaming at each other. My wife was even worse with him, she just had nothing left. By that time, if our son even came in to the same room as her, she would just stop whatever she was doing and start screaming “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY! GET THE FUCK OUT!” until he left. He started spending more and more time out of the house, which was a blessing for us. I have no idea what he got up to out in the world, but we were just happy it wasn’t being inflicted on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of our son’s behavior, we had invested heavily in locks around our house. All of the cheap, thin interior doors in our home had been replaced with think, dense wood doors that couldn’t be kicked through, equipped with keyed locks that my wife and I carried keys to. I know it sounds extreme, but locks and heavy doors were the best way we had found to create safe spaces from him. And again, before I am inundated with messages, I was not locking my son in rooms like a prisoner, he had free reign of the house and could come and go as he pleased. My wife and I would lock OURSELVES in rooms to protect ourselves from him, if anything WE were the prisoners in our own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day in question, I had fought with my son in the morning and he had left the house in a rage. My wife and I were enjoying some peace and quiet in the kitchen while our daughter napped in our bedroom. And then my daughter began crying. Any parent who has young children can tell you, you get used to your child’s cries and you can tell after a while what they need, they cry differently if they are hungry, or need changing, or are just restless and want to be held. Babies can communicate pretty well before they can speak. This cry was none of those things. This cry was terror. The second we heard it my wife and I were both up out of our chairs and running to the room. The door was locked of course, and it took a few seconds to get the right key and get it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son was in the room. We lived in a bungalow, and the bastard had climbed in the window to get to her. He was standing over her crib with a steak knife in his hand. I have no idea where he got it, it wasn’t one of ours; we controlled our knives very carefully and always kept them in locked drawers. I think he may have stolen it from one of our neighbor’s houses. He had broken her skin twice already, once in the belly area and once on her arm. I could see blood running down. When I entered the room he was dragging the back of the knife down her face, not cutting, almost tickling her with it, teasing her while she screamed. He looked up at us and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I knew what I was doing, I was already moving, running to put myself between them. I didn’t think about it, I just moved instinctively. Even with that, my wife got there faster, it was like a movie on fast forward, she got to our son and bashed his hand away, knocking the knife across the room and then shoved him with her whole body weight, so hard that he flew away from the crib and bounced off the wall. I picked up my daughter and held her while my wife screened us. I could see her shaking, almost convulsing. I can remember the smell of the room, the sound of my daughter screaming and wailing. The look on my son’s face as he stood there. Just nothing. Blank, dead, there was nothing in his eyes, no emotion. He looked like an alien to me. I watched my wife take a step toward him. I could have reached out and stopped her, but I didn’t. She stepped forward again, very close to him. I could have stopped her again. But I didn’t. She waited, looking at him for maybe 3 to 5 seconds without moving. And then she punched him in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now until this point, you may have been picturing my wife as a typical woman, small frame, dainty, delicate. This is not the case. My wife does have a small frame, but dainty and delicate she is not, never has been since I’ve known her. Since her early teens, my wife has been a boxer. MMA didn’t exist back then, but karate and boxing were big in those days, and my wife was a VERY talented amateur. She was about 130 pounds, she carried a lot of muscle and she knew how to punch. I had 70 pounds on her back then, and I have no doubt that in a real fight between me and her she could have and would have pounded me flat. Neither of us had ever laid a hand on our son in anger before, but something broke in her that day, and all the years of anger and pain and sorrow and frustration just came pouring out. When she hit him his head snapped back and blood started pouring out of his nose. He hardly reacted, he just looked at her with this shocked expression like he didn’t know how to process what had just happened. She waited another second. And then she hit him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have reached out and stopped her. I could have dragged her out of the room, taken her away, calmed her. I didn’t. I just stood there and watched while she systematically started to pound him to a pulp. Every time he brought his hands to cover one part she would blast him somewhere else, body, head, body, head, over and over. He started screaming, crying out, yelling for her to stop. It’s the most genuine reaction I’d ever seen him have to anything in his whole life. But she wasn’t stopping. I watched her ramping up, hitting harder, faster, working him like a heavy bag. He tried to swing at her and she slipped him easily. She was on auto pilot, sinking down into her training. I stood there watching for a minute. Then I turned my back on them and took my daughter out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought my daughter to the kitchen and gave her a bath in the sink. I found that he had cut her a third time on the sole of her foot. All the cuts were superficial. I cleaned her up and held her until she calmed. I put Polysporin and Band-Aids on her cuts. In our bedroom, I could hear my son screaming, calling my wife horrible names, telling her he would cut her head off and fuck her corpse. After a while, I didn’t hear him saying anything anymore, didn’t even hear him crying out. I assumed that he must have been knocked out. But I could still hear her beating him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That went on for a long time. Long enough for my daughter to drift off to sleep in my arms. I just sat at the kitchen table waiting for her to finish. Finally she came out and sat down across from me. Her hands were swollen and red. Her face and arms were splattered with blood. Her chest was heaving. We just stared at each other without saying anything. After a while I asked her “Is he dead?” She looked back at me and answered “I fucking hope so”. I nodded. That was all there was to say about that. I understood how she felt perfectly. I felt the same. I didn’t know what to do, so we just sat there waiting silently. Eventually my wife started crying and went to go take a shower. I just stayed where I was holding our daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long while, I heard moaning and sobbing coming from our room. It turned out that my son wasn’t dead. I went in to see how bad it was, and it was… pretty bad. I’ve never seen a more merciless beating laid onto anyone, before or since. He was lying on the floor, rolling around with blood leaking out of his face, lying in a pool of vomit. His nose was squashed flat out across his face, both of his eyes were completely swollen shut and starting to blacken already. I could see that a couple of his fingers were bent out at weird angles and he had pissed his pants. I think he must have been missing teeth, but I couldn’t see any on the floor and I couldn&amp;#39;t see inside his mouth, his lips were all puffed up and swollen.

She told me she kicked him in the groin repeatedly until her legs got tired, and had kept beating his body long after he had passed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my wife came out of the shower, I still didn’t know what to do about our son. I didn’t know whether to call the police or an ambulance, take him to the hospital myself, I honestly didn’t have any idea what to do.

Especially in manga/anime. 

Personally, as a girl, I can give a crap less. 

I really how how some girls give off the impression that they can dress however they want because you won't be able to touch them. It just bothers me that people ignore the double standard--

Like One Punch Man is a good example. I love the series to all end--Great story and amazing ass characters I can seriously get behind. But since it's a hero-world, it's majority guys--I don't mind because I don't really watch for the 'equality between genders'. And since it's majority guys, there aren't many girls. So that means once a girl comes in (especially heroines), people get super butt-hurt if god forbid Murata shows a little more skin than they're used to. I don't care because I actually like that the girls can show whatever because they want since they're powerful and FICTIONAL. While some guys over here are practically naked and show their bodies because I don't know--They're people who dress how they want.

There's this tumblr account I really like that follows the manga but they really get SJW with the girls and it bothers me to the point where I immediately skip over the posts where they talk about female equality in the series. An instance in the manga: one female CIVILIAN side character fights against a HERO side character in a martial arts tournament, and no surprise that she gets defeated. People got crazy and berated Murata for making her lose because apparently there's no such thing as equality to him? People actually thought since she was a girl who was RUMORED to be super strong in the FEMALE'S division of the martial arts world that she'd be able to beat a high-ranking HERO who fights MONSTERS for a living :/ Even in the manga when he won, the audience booed at him for raising a fist against a girl so...

Same goes to My Hero Academia when Bakugou went against Uraraka in the Sports Festival. The audience thought he was going too hard against her and because she was a girl that his standards should be lowered to meet hers so there's 'equality'. And that's a bunch of bullshit and I'm glad Aizawa said what he said.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate this equality bullshit that people try to imply into fiction. FICTION for god's sake. I read manga to get away from this SJW crap and I don't want to be reading something created by an author who was pressured by fans to make into their standard. 

For god's sake, if you don't like how there's more guys than girls--Watch Sailor Moon or something. 

If you don't like how girls are dressed--Maybe invest into a show that meets your 'expectations'.

If you want the guys to be beat by girls for whatever goddamn reason in your twisted mind--Stay the fuck out of my shows and go somewhere else instead of staying in the fandom and berating something that ain't gonna change because frankly No. One. Gives. A. Fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I, as a girl, don't give a fuck about your female empowerment agenda in my fiction. Go fuck off somewhere else because the things I watch don't need to be censored and crap because your ideals. Make Merlin from SDS naked, I don't care because she's one of the strongest Sins! Give a bad ass girl some booty shorts in a video game because I'd like to admire the booty too! Let the girls from BNHA show some skin because their bad ass powers is the real thing that  villains are gonna be scared of!

I personally look up to a lot of female characters in the things I read/watch because I want to be as strong as them. They're one of the only reasons why I'm not overweight as fuck after I'm being told to love my body--I don't think me being winded by walking from point A to point B is a good thing, I shouldn't be able to grab a handful of fat from my stomach or arms, and for god's sake don't even get me started with berating people for their interpretation of their work (characters, ideals, and all) because it hurts my 'feelings' that there aren't enough representation for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say that if you don't like a work, bounce. There's nothing stopping you from finding another thing that you might actually like. But to continue harassing the artist/author to add more female characters to create balance, or cover up skin because you don't like seeing some cleavage or ass, or making a girl unrealistically beat a guy...Bounce already.

I personally see that kind of harassment as putting down women and not seeing their qualities as a way of showing empowerment. You don't speak for me and I don't speak for you but I can tell you that you should fuck off if you have a problem with the work.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of people who don&amp;#39;t like how girls are dressed in fiction?

I was always off put by how she handled dealings with another friend of ours and how their relationship was very strange since he(not the potential love interest) was married and she(the love interest) was not his wife. It was very flirty and more than just a little PG-13. 

Now, after those 2 years, since I've gotten to spend time with her alone. I decided to ask her on a date. We went out for coffee and talked about art and each other's struggle with depression and how shitty our parents were. Well she decided she didn't want to go on another date. She gave this hint by ghosting all the other plans we had to hangout. I took the hint, and felt disrespected.

 Now we fast forward to the present(about 6 months). We got a chance to hangout again. This time we sat around and talked about the same things without the nervous air of a date setting. In all my life I've never thought about spending my life with someone more. 

It's weird because I don't think she feels the same so I never told her. It makes hanging out with her a little strange because I don't want to be overbearing and risk letting her know. But I also want to be her friend and just pray that sometime along the line she will see me in the same light.

This might sound like infatuation, or like I'm overreacting but I've never been able to give an honest answer as to why I say I loved a significant other but now I could list 20 different reasons why I think I'm in love with this one.

&lt;p&gt;Now, after those 2 years, since I&amp;#39;ve gotten to spend time with her alone. I decided to ask her on a date. We went out for coffee and talked about art and each other&amp;#39;s struggle with depression and how shitty our parents were. Well she decided she didn&amp;#39;t want to go on another date. She gave this hint by ghosting all the other plans we had to hangout. I took the hint, and felt disrespected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we fast forward to the present(about 6 months). We got a chance to hangout again. This time we sat around and talked about the same things without the nervous air of a date setting. In all my life I&amp;#39;ve never thought about spending my life with someone more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s weird because I don&amp;#39;t think she feels the same so I never told her. It makes hanging out with her a little strange because I don&amp;#39;t want to be overbearing and risk letting her know. But I also want to be her friend and just pray that sometime along the line she will see me in the same light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound like infatuation, or like I&amp;#39;m overreacting but I&amp;#39;ve never been able to give an honest answer as to why I say I loved a significant other but now I could list 20 different reasons why I think I&amp;#39;m in love with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Found my dream girl, don&amp;#39;t think she feels the same. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

I will be attending my first year of college this Fall. While I can't wait to get out of my small town, I feel like I am going to completely fail my first year. My grades in high school were really good (above a 4.0), but, in an advanced class called Lights, I had to complete a capstone project for my senior year. In this class we got to pick what we wanted to do projects on based on our passions and interests.  I wanted to do my capstone on different theories of creation in different religions and different scientific theories. (I am planning on majoring in geology so I wanted to figure out what I believed about how the Earth was created before I studied it). The thing is, I was so completely stressed out during the entire project that it stopped being fun. The whole point of the project was to research something I actually wanted to learn. I remember my classmates being stressed but still loving their projects. My teacher, who I was close to, would check in on our progress every couple of weeks and I started to fall behind on deadlines. At one point I was so behind and stressed out that I completely broke down during a checkin. While my classmates were working on their projects, I was sobbing at my teachers desk. If I couldn't handle the stress of this project how could I handle the next four years of college? The college I will be attending is known for being extremely difficult, but it has the best program for my major. I'm so scared I will completely stress myself out and shut down. Academics are the only thing that I'm good at and my parents expect me to do not only well, but to make an excellent grades.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr &lt;/p&gt;

No I didn’t bully them in any way at all, what I mean that I feel guilty about is that I wonder if I just had asked her out like I was planning on doing a day earlier, maybe she wouldn’t have done it. 

I met her in a STEM class that I took and I almost remember the day before she committed suicide crystal clear. As the socially awkward kid who had a crush, I’d try to bring up whatever to keep talking to her just so I can hear her talk because I liked hearing her talk. Others would say she looked “okay” or “eh” but I thought she was the prettiest one there. Everyday when I went into that class I looked forward to seeing her and talking to her. She never showed any signs of sadness or anything (or I just didn’t pay attention closely.) After school I finally grew a pair and decided to ask her out. 

Next day rolled around and I entered my first period that was my English class and sat in my desk waiting for the bell to ring and for announcements.

Really devastated to the point for the first time I cried in school and had to take a step outside to collect myself.

Not even my math teacher (who everyone hated because he was a total dick and even came in drunk once.) told me to do anything since I guess that I was the straight A student, I’d get it made up the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, we were never that well off. My mother did her best to support my little brother and I, and my father (and my brothers father) didn't do anything to help. The American Dream, right? We bounced between housing system to housing system, even living in a hotel for about 4 months because we had nowhere else to go.

&amp;#x200B;

We had our ups and downs, and for most of my teenage years we had our ups. Sure, we hit the roadblock here and there, but my mother always got through it just to support her 2 children. But as time went on, you could tell that my mother was starting to lose it. Everywhere we went, she kept hearing people call her names like ""whore"" and ""slut"" and for some reason, she cares about what other people think of her, even if it's super negative. Every time this happened, we would get home and she would have an episode. Blinded by rage, she would smash everything she could get her hands on, scream at the top of her lungs, and more often than not the police would be called by neighbors. (we lived in an Apartment complex during most of this period of time)

&amp;#x200B;

For a while, it settled down. I began to feel like I had a ""normal"" life. My mother went back to school, got her degree in social services, and after bouncing around temporary jobs to make ends meet, she got a job in the local housing authority making enough money to support us and still have a little extra money on the side. I graduated high school against all odds, got a job at the local movie theater, and started going to college for my degree in Architecture.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day, my mother got fired. For absolutely no reason. Her boss said it was because of ""insubordination"", but all my mother did was follow what the rulebook said when her boss would tell her otherwise. I won't get into details, but that place is corrupt and just left a bad taste in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, one thing I forgot to mention is that during her episodes, sometimes she'd say that killing herself would be better than all this, and she even tried it a couple times during her worst episodes. The paramedics would just say she had a mild ""panic attack"" when they came around to check her out, but it was much deeper than this. Nobody knew it though. But the thought of my mother killing herself never really left me. At first, I would dread it, not knowing what I would do without her. She was everything to me. She supported us, and she loved us. But as time went on, and the episodes kept happening, I eventually thought that maybe suicide wasn't the \*worst\* option. She was (and still is) clearly suffering from some sort of mental disorder, and it has taken full control of her life and the relationships she has with other people. Suicide would just make it all go away. She could finally be at peace, and I can finally move on past all these years of torment and uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

What caused me to write this out, was that she just had another episode and we had the police called on us, again. They came, talked to her, which ended up with nothing happening and the police leaving. I know that it's not good for my mental health to live in this situation, but I have no other choice right now. I can't imagine how my little brother (who is only 15yrs old) feels. Right now, I wish she'd just end it all and take her own life. End her suffering, and end mine. I don't know what I'd do next, in terms of a living situation and supporting both my brother and I. But if it meant that my mother's suffering would end, and she could finally rest, I want it to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this sweet girl with 3 small girls. She lived with her abusive husband. Often, she gave the expression; she wanted to leave, but he kept threatening her, if she did, he would take the girls away from her.

One day she came over for a visit. She was so happy, but also in tears, because her grandma was sick, and they didn’t believe she would live for much longer. Since she had been close to her grandma, her only wish was to be able to go home and say goodbye.

She knew the money was short, but she had saved up a bit of her own money for the trip and then she hoped for her husband would lend her the rest, for the trip out of state. She was so happy; he had said yes; she was able to travel.

When the time came, he changed his mind, due to the fact she had not done the laundry, and he did not have clean underwear in his drawer. She came over crying, felt the only option was to leave him and the children and never return, she wanted to see her grandma before she died.

The following evening, she got a phone call, that her grandma had died, and she never made it up there to say goodbye. When she asked for money for a ticket to go to the funeral, she was told no!!

not hearing from her for a while week, I called her to see how she was doing? She told me what had happened, and cried while repeating, “I didn’t get to say goodbye.” 30 minutes later, we hung up and I continue with what I did before our conversation, thinking this was going to be the last conversation about her grandma, well at least I thought so.

At first, she said no, but she could hear it in my tone of voice, I was serious, so she put a note on the door for the kids and ran across the street.

She came in and I took her into the bedroom and told her to sit down, at first she said: “no”, asked, why: “what is that smell of flowers, it smells like my grandma’s perfume?” I said: “close your eyes “and she did.

Tears were running down her face, and with closed eyes, she said: “my grandma is here, it is her, I can feel her around me, her present, her energy, and her perfume, she is giving me a hug.” After they had been standing there for a while, my friend said: “my grandma is leaving now.” She opened her eyes and the smell of flowery perfume slowly went away. She stayed for a little while before she went home, she asked: “how did you know?”

I told her: “the smell the flowers, came right after you and I had talked, and I felt someone close, wanted to say goodbye.

I apologized to him, went for a dinner, cooked him the best meals, and hugged him until he promised he is good now

so, we are good.

then yesterday, i told him that i am interested in what he asked, now just to tell you all, i have never had sex with anyone except my husband, and that too with him after marriage.

So i told him i am new to this, and replied the same, he said he fantasize this a lot and wants this, we talked about pros and cons and then i told him i will search on internet, which really meant that i will post in this subreddit for my supportive redditors to suggest me

His idea: invite his boss to home for a dinner, and he goes away for market to get something that i missed, while i am in shower, so after he is gone, i will start calling him from bathroom, but his boss would answer me and i will ask him to fetch me towel and my lingerie from another room, and that would lead to something.

My best friend and I met on tumblr about 3 years back. We’ve grown incredibly close to the point where we consider each other somewhat of soulmates. 

The problem is, I used to have a habit of lying about my age to people I met online in an attempt to be taken more seriously. She’s one of the people I lied to, saying that I was 2 years older than I actually am (I’m 16, she thinks I’m 18, she’s 21) I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time because it was just a silly little tumblr acquaintance. Well, 3 years later and we’ve met several times irl, I’m traveling out of the country to visit her for 10 days next month, and we’re kinda sorta becoming more than just friends. I’ve felt guilty about lying for all these years but feared if I said anything it would ruin our relationship because I had betrayed her trust for so long. 

Tonight we had a conversation about entering into a romantic relationship and I just couldn’t do it anymore. I’ve felt guilty enough about lying to a friend but I can’t in good conscious enter into a romantic relationship someone who doesn’t know my real age. I know I’ve finally done the right thing and if she decides to end our friendship she’s more than justified and I deserve everything that I get. It’s still eating me up inside though and I’m terrified.

She’s asleep so she hasn’t seen my text yet and I’m having a bit of a panic attack. It’s time for me to accept consequences for my actions but I just can’t imagine my life without her. I’m a dumbass and I hate that I’ve done this to myself. I’ve betrayed the trust of the person in this world I’m closest to and I’m just hoping I don’t lose her now :(

Edit: Just to clarify a few things: 

- my friend and I have met in real life a few times now. We do live in different countries (Canada and the US) but she has traveled here a few times (her coming to the US usually makes more economic sense than me traveling to her). She’s not a creep or a serial killer and I’m not a creep or a serial killer. She’s met my family and they all think she’s great. I’ve met her family over skype several times, they’re also great people. 

- I’m a female. This isn’t that important but I just thought I’d point that out as a lot of people are calling me “he” when I’m actually a “she”

- Yes, we met on tumblr. No, we didn’t meet in any weird communities. Neither of us have used tumblr for quite some time and our friendship has far moved past that. 

- we were both teenagers when we first met. It’s not like she was some creepy adult preying on a kid. We were both in high school when we first became friends.

I will keep you guys updated

UPDATE: Okay, so she woke up a bit ago and read my message and reacted.... really well!!! She’s not mad or upset really, just surprised. We had a long discussion and she seems genuinely okay for our friendship to just continue on as usual. I think she could tell that I had had a weight on my shoulders for a long time but wasn’t able to quite piece things together so now things make a little more sense to her. She knows me well enough to understand why I did what I did and doesn’t feel hurt. More than anything she appreciates that I was able to be honest with her even tho it was difficult for me. 

The “more than friends” thing has kind of been left in the air for now and for the moment we’re just focusing on us as friends and I’m not mad about it. If it’s meant to happen it’ll happen and neither of us are gonna push it. I get the feeling that our friendship is gonna be even more solid moving forward. 

Here are a few excerpts from what she had to say. There was much, much more said by both of us but most of that was very personal and I don’t feel comfortable sharing. Hopefully this is enough to summarize the convo:

So yeah! Thanks for going on this journey with me! I feel so much better and more content. It’s like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Thanks yall for keeping me company while I panicked.

We do live in different countries (Canada and the US) but she has traveled here a few times (her coming to the US usually makes more economic sense than me traveling to her). She’s not a creep or a serial killer and I’m not a creep or a serial killer. She’s met my family and they all think she’s great. I’ve met her family over skype several times, they’re also great people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a female. This isn’t that important but I just thought I’d point that out as a lot of people are calling me “he” when I’m actually a “she”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we met on tumblr. No, we didn’t meet in any weird communities. Neither of us have used tumblr for quite some time and our friendship has far moved past that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we were both teenagers when we first met. It’s not like she was some creepy adult preying on a kid. We were both in high school when we first became friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep you guys updated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Okay, so she woke up a bit ago and read my message and reacted.... really well!!! She’s not mad or upset really, just surprised. We had a long discussion and she seems genuinely okay for our friendship to just continue on as usual. I think she could tell that I had had a weight on my shoulders for a long time but wasn’t able to quite piece things together so now things make a little more sense to her. She knows me well enough to understand why I did what I did and doesn’t feel hurt. More than anything she appreciates that I was able to be honest with her even tho it was difficult for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “more than friends” thing has kind of been left in the air for now and for the moment we’re just focusing on us as friends and I’m not mad about it. If it’s meant to happen it’ll happen and neither of us are gonna push it. I get the feeling that our friendship is gonna be even more solid moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few excerpts from what she had to say. There was much, much more said by both of us but most of that was very personal and I don’t feel comfortable sharing. Hopefully this is enough to summarize the convo: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/mdZbDpi""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/mdZbDpi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah! Thanks for going on this journey with me! I feel so much better and more content. It’s like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Thanks yall for keeping me company while I panicked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will definitely update again if anything changes in the next day or two but I think things are gonna be good :)&lt;/p&gt;

It was just the three of us; I was the only girl. Long story short, I had a really bad experience...

I saw something really disturbing--and I saw it so clearly--that I don't know how it could have been a hallucination, although they told me it was. Here’s what happened, from my perspective: 

I was sitting in a chair in the middle of the friend’s room, my arms wrapped around my legs which were pulled up to my chest, and rocking back and forth intensely. My ex was standing on one side of me and his friend was standing on the other, both of them facing me, and they were laughing and unzipping their pants—in a sadistic, mocking sort of way. I remember having this intense fear that they were going to sexually assault/rape me (which was why I was shaking back and forth in fear).

The next day I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said the part about me rocking back and forth was true--that I looked really scared and freaked out--but that he and his friend never did the pants stuff. I didn't push him for more information after that; I didn't want him to think I was crazy, so I just dropped the subject. And I never brought it up to the other guy, since he was my boyfriend's friend and we weren't that close. I'd only hung out with him on a few occasions and we didn’t speak at all after the incident.

It's driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and remember the fear so deeply, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a ""bad trip."" But I've smoked pot (although I haven't taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. I’ve always felt very in control of my reality on drugs and never saw anything that wasn’t really happening. 

Is it possible that weed can make you hallucinate like this? Could they have given me a different drug? Other things that happened during this episode were that I saw lights flashing on and off and blinds opening and closing at a rapid pace...basically everything was sped up like in fast forward motion. It scared me so bad, I thought I was dying. 

Please help! I’ve had so much trouble sleeping since then. I still have recurring dreams about being raped and have even started to question whether I was raped or sexually abused during my childhood and that’s why I had that reaction to the drugs, like maybe a suppressed memory or something. Or maybe there’s nothing wrong with me and I’m totally normal but they tricked me and accused me of hallucinating and now I’m starting to believe them... :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, when I was a junior in college, I tried a pot brownie for the first time with my boyfriend and his friend.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and remember the fear so deeply, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a &amp;quot;bad trip.&amp;quot; But I&amp;#39;ve smoked pot (although I haven&amp;#39;t taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. I’ve always felt very in control of my reality on drugs and never saw anything that wasn’t really happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that weed can make you hallucinate like this? Could they have given me a different drug? Other things that happened during this episode were that I saw lights flashing on and off and blinds opening and closing at a rapid pace...basically everything was sped up like in fast forward motion. It scared me so bad, I thought I was dying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help! I’ve had so much trouble sleeping since then. I still have recurring dreams about being raped and have even started to question whether I was raped or sexually abused during my childhood and that’s why I had that reaction to the drugs, like maybe a suppressed memory or something. Or maybe there’s nothing wrong with me and I’m totally normal but they tricked me and accused me of hallucinating and now I’m starting to believe them... :(&lt;/p&gt;

This is so petty and I won’t confront her about this because that would be silly. For reference, I am a grown-ass woman.

I loved Stranger 3 Things SO MUCH. My friend is a huge fan too and just started it today. I told her to call me after the first episode so we could be excited about it.

She just called me and immediately said in a whiny voice that she had a problem with it. She complained that the scenes where Hopper was upset/struggling with El spending all her time with Mike bothered her, made her uncomfortable, and made her cringe.

She was like “El should be allowed to make out with her damn boyfriend!” Ok... but that’s not the point! The show isn’t framing Hopper as “the good guy” in the situation, obviously he’s handling it wrong. He’s even trying to do better. I thought it was all so hilarious and real, I laughing so hard it hurt!

The way she is is that she refuses to enjoy or laugh at things that involve something that goes against her beliefs in any way, even if the offender is obviously the one in the wrong. It makes watching movies with her such a drag.

I am literally angry about it. It makes me not want to talk to her about the show, let alone watch it with her tonight.

I please urge people that misuse substances to get help. Much like alcoholics, there are high functioning alcoholics etc. One doesn't have to be a mess to find themselves being a ""Mess"". If you or your partner are in a difficult time, it's really hard to admit, even to oneself, nevermind someone else. There are so many effects of a partner's substance abuse, that no one speaks of it. I'll post a video below. But before any person watches it, this is the life a lot of people have every day, 24 hours per day.

There are good people out there that try their best to look after people like this, but realise it is an illness that can be helped. For the person, who loves the person, and try their best, it becomes a living hell for the people that care about the person. The sad thing is, the person that tries their best to help the person they care about, is always the first in the firing line for when the person acts out or lashes out. It's one of the hardest things in the world. Most that know where I'm coming from, would probably, from past experience, 

recommend medical intervention. Please, for anyone suffering this, living day in and out, please get the person you love medical help. (be it alcohol, medication, cannabis etc) because today might be your last chance to get the person help.


Anyone that is in a relationship with someone that is diagnosed/ undiagnosed with GAD/SAD/SIAD, keep up the good fight. Sometimes it is hard,sometimes always, it is fucking difficult caring for someone you love, but even though you can't talk to anyone about what you are going through, there are people here.

I had an amazing childhood that I cannot complain about in any way, and I used to feel like such a 'positive' person. For example, I have a distinct memory of when I was around 6 or 7, I was having this conversation with my dad about what I wanted my impact on the world to be. I remember saying things like ""I want to be a hero and do what is best for everyone"" and I really felt this way, all I wanted to do when I was younger was have some great positive impact on society or the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the girl stuff started. I cant remember when exactly I started realizing that I just wasn't getting the same results as all my friends, maybe it was around 14? 15? Not sure, but I remember realizing that no one else saw me the way I saw myself. I never doubted my intelligence, my wit, my humor; I had confidence in all of that. And all my friends recognized that I had these positive qualities too. But literally no female that I was attracted to, FOR YEARS, showed any sign of recognition or appreciation of these qualities. I don't even know why I put such an emphasis on the validation of a girl being a requirement for me to feel good about myself, but I did. I think I just wanted to be like my friends and not feel like the only one who nobody wanted. I remember I started cutting myself as I started feeling more and more powerless about myself. I won't go into it too much but I've always been a very emotional person and I would cry myself to sleep on some nights, just thinking about how any gift I had, as a person, was a waste. If no one else could appreciate those gifts, they were pointless to even have.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was around 17, I got my first girlfriend but this did not even come close to solving the problem. We broke up within 3 months and since then, I've maybe dated 3 or 4 other girls, with NOT ONE SINGLE relationship lasting more than 6 months. I am at the point now where I am slowly giving up on the idea of 'love' and I am seriously trying to become comfortable with the concept of living and dying alone. The one girl that ever said she loved me eventually admitted ""I just said that because you said it"" and it hurt even more then. I slowly realized, none of these girls even liked me, they probably just put up with me or were using me for something. I was also really jealous of how simple and easy it would be for my friends to simply go to a party or something, meet a girl that night, and get involved with her instantly, just like that. NOT ONCE in my life, never once, has a girl ever gotten interested in me the night I met her, it's always the 'long game' for me, which further makes me believe no one ever will really like me.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 25 year old me and I quite honestly now believe the erasure of humanity as a species is unequivocally a net-benefit to the planet. I hold hatred for strangers and random people I dont even know because I have this inexplicable feeling that they all constantly judge and hate me right back, in equal measure. I believe this all extends back to the lack of attention I got from women. I distinctly remember feeling like I had 2 choices: kill myself or avenge myself. I chose the latter, which I interpreted to mean that the world around me had misjudged me and therefore it earned my hatred. I began seeing all people as thinking the same way, because I felt like the whole world was against me. This mindset has given me great confidence and motivation/drive for myself because I have this chip on my shoulder all the time. However, I also see that this is an unhealthy mindset to have and it wears down on you after awhile. Still, I realize negativity is unattractive and whenever I do talk to girls, I do a pretty good job of behaving normally and not complaining, so as to not scare them off. Still, no girl I ever talk to actually shows interest, its all just small talk. Some of my friends will openly put me to the test and have me approach girls at parties and such because EVEN THEY dont believe I'm totally hopeless. Well, every single girl I've tried to get with during these 'tests', gives me their number but just never texts back again. HOPELESS. All my friends can go places and pick up girls no problem, and I simply cannot do that. No matter how hard I try, how funny I am, how much of a good listener I am; none of it matters because all women intrinsically hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

The saddest part is I truly do not know why. Contrary to popular belief, I actually DO think I am an attractive male, I've never personally seen myself as 'ugly' but women keep trying to make me believe I am. I am pretty funny, like I said, all my friends are my friends most likely BECAUSE OF that humor. I am 5'7"" which is short I guess, but even short girls hate me. I dont know what to do and I truly believe that someday I may be driven to do something drastic out of frustration, just to get the smallest ounce of REVENGE back for the lifetime of rejection and disgust I've been served. I am mixed race, my father is white and my mother is black, which is an uncommon combination; I have frequently thought that maybe no one is attracted to this particular combination. Like if i was 100% white or 100% black, I think I would do wayyyyy better with women because then your not some wishy-washy 'hybrid', I would instead be more DEFINED. Or who knows, maybe my judgement of my own looks is off and I just am fuckin ugly but in all honesty, I dont think I deserve this. I have not a clue in hell why it is happening to me, and all I can do in retaliation is let my hatred for everyone build and build as I slowly morph into some kind of villain. This was never what I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I am aware of INCEL culture and I think it is cringy, pathetic, and horribly embarassing. I want no part of this. I do not hate all women or have ill will towards them, I just realize they all hate me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember being a young kid, growing up with my parents and being genuinely ecstatic about life.

And all my friends recognized that I had these positive qualities too. But literally no female that I was attracted to, FOR YEARS, showed any sign of recognition or appreciation of these qualities. I don&amp;#39;t even know why I put such an emphasis on the validation of a girl being a requirement for me to feel good about myself, but I did. I think I just wanted to be like my friends and not feel like the only one who nobody wanted. I remember I started cutting myself as I started feeling more and more powerless about myself. I won&amp;#39;t go into it too much but I&amp;#39;ve always been a very emotional person and I would cry myself to sleep on some nights, just thinking about how any gift I had, as a person, was a waste. If no one else could appreciate those gifts, they were pointless to even have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was around 17, I got my first girlfriend but this did not even come close to solving the problem. We broke up within 3 months and since then, I&amp;#39;ve maybe dated 3 or 4 other girls, with NOT ONE SINGLE relationship lasting more than 6 months. I am at the point now where I am slowly giving up on the idea of &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; and I am seriously trying to become comfortable with the concept of living and dying alone. The one girl that ever said she loved me eventually admitted &amp;quot;I just said that because you said it&amp;quot; and it hurt even more then. I slowly realized, none of these girls even liked me, they probably just put up with me or were using me for something. I was also really jealous of how simple and easy it would be for my friends to simply go to a party or something, meet a girl that night, and get involved with her instantly, just like that. NOT ONCE in my life, never once, has a girl ever gotten interested in me the night I met her, it&amp;#39;s always the &amp;#39;long game&amp;#39; for me, which further makes me believe no one ever will really like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 25 year old me and I quite honestly now believe the erasure of humanity as a species is unequivocally a net-benefit to the planet. I hold hatred for strangers and random people I dont even know because I have this inexplicable feeling that they all constantly judge and hate me right back, in equal measure. I believe this all extends back to the lack of attention I got from women. I distinctly remember feeling like I had 2 choices: kill myself or avenge myself. I chose the latter, which I interpreted to mean that the world around me had misjudged me and therefore it earned my hatred. I began seeing all people as thinking the same way, because I felt like the whole world was against me. This mindset has given me great confidence and motivation/drive for myself because I have this chip on my shoulder all the time. However, I also see that this is an unhealthy mindset to have and it wears down on you after awhile. Still, I realize negativity is unattractive and whenever I do talk to girls, I do a pretty good job of behaving normally and not complaining, so as to not scare them off. Still, no girl I ever talk to actually shows interest, its all just small talk. Some of my friends will openly put me to the test and have me approach girls at parties and such because EVEN THEY dont believe I&amp;#39;m totally hopeless. Well, every single girl I&amp;#39;ve tried to get with during these &amp;#39;tests&amp;#39;, gives me their number but just never texts back again. HOPELESS. All my friends can go places and pick up girls no problem, and I simply cannot do that. No matter how hard I try, how funny I am, how much of a good listener I am; none of it matters because all women intrinsically hate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddest part is I truly do not know why. Contrary to popular belief, I actually DO think I am an attractive male, I&amp;#39;ve never personally seen myself as &amp;#39;ugly&amp;#39; but women keep trying to make me believe I am. I am pretty funny, like I said, all my friends are my friends most likely BECAUSE OF that humor. I am 5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot; which is short I guess, but even short girls hate me. I dont know what to do and I truly believe that someday I may be driven to do something drastic out of frustration, just to get the smallest ounce of REVENGE back for the lifetime of rejection and disgust I&amp;#39;ve been served. I am mixed race, my father is white and my mother is black, which is an uncommon combination; I have frequently thought that maybe no one is attracted to this particular combination. Like if i was 100% white or 100% black, I think I would do wayyyyy better with women because then your not some wishy-washy &amp;#39;hybrid&amp;#39;, I would instead be more DEFINED. Or who knows, maybe my judgement of my own looks is off and I just am fuckin ugly but in all honesty, I dont think I deserve this. I have not a clue in hell why it is happening to me, and all I can do in retaliation is let my hatred for everyone build and build as I slowly morph into some kind of villain. This was never what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I am aware of INCEL culture and I think it is cringy, pathetic, and horribly embarassing. I want no part of this. I do not hate all women or have ill will towards them, I just realize they all hate me.&lt;/p&gt;

So i always went after older girls or ""Mature ladies"" who knew what they wanted and when they wanted it... Well I met this girl, ill just call her wendy for the sake of the story....Well wendy was ruffly dubble my age with a kid 4 to 5 years younger then me. She had money but was humble with it she didnt have everything in the world or any of that but she made a little more then enough money to cover her bills and such but she knew my parents and how broke they were so always did her best to show up so she could pay my dad for what he did so she became a regular client of my dads always comming by to see him and to do bdsm stuff...( bondage and basic kink stuff) with her... Well after about a month of her coming over to see my dad i finally decided to talk to her and ask her who she was... She said her name and proceeded to go on and on about how mature i was for my age and how I knew so much about what goes on...(bdsm wise) and she asked me if id ever done it and well i was young and dumb so i said yea totally why...? And she said well im glad u found out for yourself... So she left and she didnt come back for a while
After a few days i began to worry if id see her again. It wasnt out of the unusual for my dads clients to just up and leave... Once they got what they wanted theyd leave or keep coming around depending on what the person was into. Well after about a week and a few days she came back. And so i told her my name and said i was my dads kid and it was nice to see her again. And thats when it happend... Thats the moment i knew i liked girls that were older then me she sent signals that were clear hard and heavy and over the next few weeks we began to talk more and she would show up more and eventually she started to show up when my dad wasnt there.. My dad was fine with it because we all trusted her and we were right to ... And over that next month i began to let her know how happy she made me just coming over and talking and playing games with me and such.
(And this is the happy but sad part)
After i told her she told me she liked it too she never had anyone to play online games with. so i had her add me on my xbox and she did and after another week of playing and hanging online she bought me a game ( gears of war i think) and she got herself a copy 2 and we began to play that together. Well after. A few games and lost of long weekends playing games online together she came over again and this time no one was home... It was just me and wendy.

So me being a kid i asked her if she wanted to hangout and play games with me and she said yes so i took her to my room and showed her my setup and how i play and such and after about 15 mins i pause the game and put on a show... After about 20 mins idk how it started but we started play fighting and i fell...
Like off the bed and hit the floor hard... And after i got up she ask me if i was ok and i said yeah totally ok and then i got light headed and fell back words onto my bed and when i did she got on top of me and checked my head and while she was her breasts were like in my face so being the boy i once was i got hard and well... Lets just say sneaking out at 2:27am to hangout with a girl for 4 hours is more then worth it...
Anyways thank you M.A for all the memories and fun times i hope to find another lover/gf/sugarmama like you some day... I hope you all enjoy my story...
(I was 13 and was about to be 14 that fallowing week so her name will be anonymous)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger.. I was raised by bdsm parents and so I learned at a very very young age what sex was so as per the usual I helped my friends in school with girls but i was never into girls my age because they were immature and werent into the same things I was, physically, Mentally, Sexually. So i always went after older girls or &amp;quot;Mature ladies&amp;quot; who knew what they wanted and when they wanted it... Well I met this girl, ill just call her wendy for the sake of the story....Well wendy was ruffly dubble my age with a kid 4 to 5 years younger then me. She had money but was humble with it she didnt have everything in the world or any of that but she made a little more then enough money to cover her bills and such but she knew my parents and how broke they were so always did her best to show up so she could pay my dad for what he did so she became a regular client of my dads always comming by to see him and to do bdsm stuff...( bondage and basic kink stuff) with her... Well after about a month of her coming over to see my dad i finally decided to talk to her and ask her who she was... She said her name and proceeded to go on and on about how mature i was for my age and how I knew so much about what goes on...(bdsm wise) and she asked me if id ever done it and well i was young and dumb so i said yea totally why...? And she said well im glad u found out for yourself... So she left and she didnt come back for a while
After a few days i began to worry if id see her again. It wasnt out of the unusual for my dads clients to just up and leave... Once they got what they wanted theyd leave or keep coming around depending on what the person was into. Well after about a week and a few days she came back. And so i told her my name and said i was my dads kid and it was nice to see her again. And thats when it happend... Thats the moment i knew i liked girls that were older then me she sent signals that were clear hard and heavy and over the next few weeks we began to talk more and she would show up more and eventually she started to show up when my dad wasnt there.. My dad was fine with it because we all trusted her and we were right to ... And over that next month i began to let her know how happy she made me just coming over and talking and playing games with me and such.
(And this is the happy but sad part)

I am new here, honestly i dont know if my post will get feedback or not.

I have a husband, 8 years into marriage, he is the most perfect man a wife would ask for

Together, we tried many fetishes, and i was always interested in what he is into, he would tell me new things, kinda dares and i would do them.

Now, last week, we were having sex and i asked him his most kinky fetish, something he never told me, i forced him until he spoke.

He told me he wants to see me having sex with his Boss, IT WAS A BIG TURN OFF FOR ME, i immediately, stopped and wore my dress and then pretended to sleep.

He realized it, and asked for forgiveness, said sorry in every way a man can.

Now, the issue is, i scolded him a lot, but when i thought about it a lot, it turned me on.

We met through Tinder a week after I turned 18, and our first date was at the mall literally 5 days after we started chatting. The date was really good but we really wanted to get more... intimate. 

I was a virgin and had kissed twice before meeting him, so I was pretty nervous about it. He suggested we went to the park and then to his house so we could make out, since both were nearby my house too. However we were horny af (me especially because I've never done that and I still am a HIGH libido girl) and decided we would only go to his house. I wouldn't be able to convince my mum to let me do that (and with reason, I was crazy horny for letting myself go to a complete stranger's house to make out), so we met at the park and went to his house walking because it was THAT nearby, I messaged my location and his adress to a friend just in case, and then we made out for a couple hours. After, we took a shower to get the sex scent off.

I then called my mom to tell her she didn't need to pick me up because my now bf (he asked me to be his girlfriend between kissing and I said yes) would call me an Uber. She said no, she'd pick me up soon. At the park.

We both panicked and got dressed as fast as we could and he tried to call me an Uber but the closest one was 7 minutes away. I couldn't go walking to the park because I was afraid my mom would see me walking on the street on her way to the park and be suspicious, since she told me VERY CLEARLY not to leave the park.

Neither I nor my bf have driver's licenses so he couldn't drive me there either.

He then asked his uncle who lives with him if he could give me a ride. He promptly got ready and I got to the park extremely embarassed about making him do it. I got there and ran a couple laps so I'd be sweaty enough for her to believe I've been there the whole afternoon and still had to wait for about 15 minutes because the concept of time is different for my mom.

I was nervous the entire fucking time I was making out, thinking she was onto me, I only felt relieved the next day.

She still doesn't know that we met through Tinder. And that my second date was not on the park. She also never lets us have sleepovers even though she knows I'm not a virgin. I don't think I can ever tell these two things to her.

I want to tell this beta faggot. You pedo fuck, You married your wife when she was 16 something and you were in your 20s because you are a beta, and did what society wanted.

You are a beta, loser who have only been with one woman your whole life without paying for her, and she left you which I can not blame her at all.  You fucking failure.  I can be a million times better business man than you If I didn't get hit by a car when I was 8 and am a Little Fucked up. Yet I still slept with 100 more beautiful women than you ever have, who really succeeded more you beta.

Ceying about your divorce. You cant see why she left you. You arent even a real man.  He would tell her to work out, he doesn't like fat women.  YET hes a 60 year old man, saggy skinned beta who is an anxious little weakling.  in 60 years he hasn't evolved.  Lifts the same light weight just for endurance.  Eats beans(EVEN WHEN I EXPLAINED IT IS FULL OF ESTROGEN) eats a bunch of estrogen veggies.  And looks like a saggy skinned shit.  He keeps saying oh how he wasted his life. The family is all spread out now. My mom left him.  He is stressed.  He is all talk though.  Keeps saying he needs to go on vacation never goes.  Keeps saying one day he needs to try weed, never does.

One thing I DO feel bad for him is he has macro degeneration where the very center of his vision is blury.  I even researched all the treatment for it to date. There was a doctor in UK who cured this old mans vision. ""Ohh I don't want to be someones gunie pig its to risky""   THEN STOP BITCHING. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I CANT SEE THIS GUY AS A REAL MAN HE IS ALWAYS A SCARED LITTLE BITCH.

Idk I just don't like my family. I find it cringy. Something inside me i get anxiety. I dont like the dynamic of a family hangout. Like the little characters my sister plays. She is bitchy. tells me on. my dad is annoying. Idk I just hate them all with a passion I want to kill them all.  I want to be left alone. I don't blame my mom for leaving him.  I used to think she was the bad one

He doesn't stop knocking on my door. Idk if he is doing it on purpose to annoy me because how can he be that annoying or retarded. He tells me stupid things the SAME THING ALL THE TIME, ""Dont let the cool air go on you, you'll get namonia""  and all that worried bullshit.  He says the same thing over.He constantly knocks on my door when I try to fap or just be alone.  Like 6 times he will keep trying to talk to me through the door and it infuriates me where one of these days I am going to yell right in his face because I have to hold it in.

I keep trying to tell him OK ENOUGH. Ok.  But I am sick of him interupting me or just talking to me and he talks to slow in his stupid accent and lectures. He just likes to talk talk talk, But I need to tell him to Shut the Fuck up no wonder your wife left you.  Fucking pathetic failure. Shut your fucking face before I break your fucking Head. I am going to kill myself soon anyways, before I do I am going to fucking Kill you you old fuck.

Idk when Ever I hear his voice I get really really REALLY IRRITATED. I finally understand why my mom left him. I used to think she was the bad one.  This guy is fucking annoying and one day I am going to snap.  He does it on purpose to, He wants to be quirky &amp;  narotic and a germaphobe like Monk from that TV show he used to watch.  He will knock on my door when he knows i am doing something just to tell me something stupid I dont need to know.

He gets stressed VERY easily like an old woman.  Scared something will happen to me. He is known for worrying a lot. I think that is partly why my mom lost attraction to him and me to him as a father.  He is not masculine.  He is a wimp. EVERYTHING socially  I do NOT want to be.  There were instances where he would be a pushover socially too.

EXAMPLE: He just knocked on my door for like the 10th time in 5 hours, and said ,""Im glad you didnt eat the fish. Because my stomach hurts now. Oh another thing, you know those little things on the side of the window AC?, you can open them to get fresh air""Like THANKS captain genius.

I have spent the last hour quite depressed with myself because I keep forgetting that I have a boyfriend, and I keep thinking about things I shouldn’t in a relationship.

I don’t want pity, I just want to explain. My life has been a shitheap of terrible happenings. Maybe I’ll post more about them when I have the energy to type out a full post, as that’s a long one.  Basically, the most relevant is that I’ve spent the better part of 7+ years going from one shit relationship to the next.

There wasn’t anything too bad between me and my first ex, we were just young and stupid and bad at talking. If we had the opportunity to give each other a chance again in the future where we’d both be single beforehand? Sure. But every relationship after him? Abusive shitheels. From gaslighting to being verbally and emotionally abusive, to potentially grooming me, to flat out abandoning and ignoring me. Yeah, I probably wasn’t the perfect partner (I do have bpd and depression, but I manage my symptoms well enough to the point most of my coworkers are surprised there’s anything mentally wrong with me), but did I deserve all the shit that happened to me? Probably not. 

Maybe karmically I deserve it somehow. I hate myself enough to believe it. Anyways, that’s not what we’re here for today.

Even from my first relationship, I started having escapist fantasies about what my life COULD be, which started off innocently enough. My first and I were too young to be doing /stuff/ (reddit help I don’t know how to do italics on mobile), so I used to daydream about our perfect honeymoon-phase future adult lives together. He was sweet and cute and kind enough that at the time, I thought we’d be together forever.

Obviously, we didn’t. He moved too far, and stopped talking so much. I wanted us over. I had a two week relationship after which really doesn’t count because we rarely spoke with one another, and he cheated. Then, while I waited for months on confirmation that we were, in fact, no longer together, I met my dork of an ex girlfriend. She was so kind to me, and flirted with me so often. I was a shy queer in a conservative area, but I fell hard. I wanted nothing more than to be with her. Unfortunately, around the same time, I started having eyes for my then-best friend. He is my forever one that got away.

Stuff happens, she moves. She turns into the complete opposite of who she used to be, I move far, faaaaarrrr away from my high school-almost-sweetheart, and lost contact with everyone else because I wanted to die. So bad.

I spent like 8 months no contact with my girlfriend before I finally bring up the questionable content she was posting about on social media, and tell her I no longer felt safe together and I wanted out. I thought I was going to be dead soon anyways, so who’d care?

I got back to my home state soon after, and flew headlong into a terrible relationship that I’m still healing from a year+ later. I met my current cutie, and while I really do like him, I’m also so used to my single life that my brain got used to that I catch myself in dangerous patterns.
After all, I spent most of my young adult life up until now (I’m still quite young) in a relationship, and it took so long to break the habits of being in those shit relationships that now I’m stuck in the single habits.

For example, roughly a year ago, I finally got out of the house, and in quite the unusual thing for me to do as a being of anxiety, I hung out for the first time in years with my old high school crush. We’d already been texting a bit because I wanted to apologize for being a flakey friend when he needed me, because I needed him, and I didn’t want to be alive at the time. I came over to shoot some fireworks off with him, and we hit it off. We did the do, and it was great. I could see us finally being a thing. My little gay heart was rejoicing.

What does this have to do with my new partner? I just had to catch myself about to message my high school flame “ready for round 2?” Like a cheesy bastard. I feel like shit. Yeah, I’m in a polyam relationship, but I still don’t have explicit permission to go around banging people. I’d have to talk to my partner and make sure they’re okay and that we are still fine together. I haven’t done that.

My logical brain still loves my boyfriend, but my toxic brain wants me to cut him off and make me think that no one will ever treat me right. Logical brain wants to stay with my current partner, but emotional brain says that I should try again with high school guy. Emotional brain says close myself off, fuck up your relationship, make him leave you.

I want to be free of relationships, but they’re a big part of what keeps me living. I do love my partner, but I have so much love, and I can’t give them enough from so desperately far away.  I want to flirt and be flirted with, but there’s no one I want to flirt with, and only creepy older men to flirt at me while I’m working, ew.

I don’t want to be thinking about others while I’m in a relationship. I don’t want to have to think so hard about my deep sleep dreams. I don’t want to keep having stupid unrealistic fantasies about other people. I want to be happy and care free. I want to not have to be inundated with these feelings. I just want to be normal.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a throwaway acct in case my bf knows my main or my porn accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

I was a 15(M) year old teenager when it happened, I was fat, like I weighted 110 KG fat.

Everyone on my family kept throwing jokes about it, not that I cared, my nickname was ""Fat"" (I live in Brazil, this makes some sort of sense here) at school and I was ok with it, I even created a persona around it and it was fun, not a problem at all, it actually helped me develop my personality and I don't regret it.

The thing is, at a random weekend, my mother wanted me to go with her to a family reunion, as you can imagine, I, a 15 yo teenager that was and still is very into playing games online with his friends, didn't want to go.

So, I made up a bullshit story about feeling ashamed of going because I didn't like the fact that everyone else made jokes about me being fat. (all bullshit of course)

My mom then said that I could stay at home and I was happy, everything went according to my plan.

The problem is, my mom rained down hell on my family members about it and told me nothing about it.

A couple of months later, it was probably around christmas, we had another reunion and I went to it. Once I got there, my aunt slightly apologizes for making jokes about it and assured me that no one else would do that. I didn't know what to do, everyone was being so polite to me, I couldn't just tell them that I lied.

So, I kept my cool and told her that it was fine.

I never told anyone this, I have to live this lie now.

Not that it wasn't a bully, it was, I just didn't cared about it and lied that I did.

On the bright side tho, everyone else started taking me seriously after that.

&lt;p&gt;We have a dog. There is a nature preserve where we take the dog. The official law is you have to keep your dog on a six foot leash, which of course no one follows since it&amp;#39;s absurd. I now have a 50-foot lead that I keep my dog on when we go hiking. 90% of it he is just sniffing around and usually ends up getting tangled in the trees. Every time someone walks by, I call him back (excellent recall) and keep him close until they pass. Every other dog we see is off-leash. I watch white guys just get through the gate and take off the leash. I&amp;#39;ve been very tempted to let him off too, but I&amp;#39;ve already had the police called on me for just walking around with him. If they catch us, it&amp;#39;ll probably be a fine and a part of me still wants them to like me. There is nothing worse than the judgy racist face of an old white lady.&lt;/p&gt;

I told him I would explain what happened to him the next time I saw him, but it was very awkward and I never wound up explaining the true reason to him (he knew it was because of the age gap but I never explained the ocd side of things.

We don’t talk anymore (it’s been a few months) and last time I saw him he looked visibly uncomfortable. He had a soft spot for me and I took advantage of that. My mutual friend even told me that it “really fucked him up.”

I’ll start from last year. I had just gotten into a new college and was very social with everyone even though this was a little out of the ordinary for me as I’m naturally introverted.

Eventually I settled with a group of friends and things started smoothly. Somewhere along the line I started to think too much about these situations or times I would spend with my friends. I used to think about what I would say, what joke of mine would make everyone laugh etc. So much so that it was becoming mentally unhealthy for me.

I lost my concentration in studies, neglected my health and eventually fell into depression. I lost so much confidence in myself that each day felt a chore to me and I couldn’t wait for it to end and get back to bed.

Maybe this behaviour was making my friends uncomfortable with me or something but it was a vicious cycle where they would hate me and I would hate them back but still keep thinking of ways to please them. This was until I took a long look at myself and thought that it was enough.

I took a vacation after that semester to take a break from all this, went completely off social media while I was there and came back a new person.

Don’t worry, it’s not just that, it gets worse. When I was 7, all I wanted for my birthday was a Princess Barbie. Mum crashed the car on MY BIRTHDAY and, has ever since, been a quadriplegic.

My only reason for not making use of people that are potentially good tools is that I'm lazy and it'd end up causing trouble for me in the long run

Last trait i have that I'll mention. Because i barely ever feel anything, i always want a thrill. Adrenaline is amazing to me. That rush is awesome. I listen to sad music simply because it sounds calming and relaxes me. I take psychedelics every now and then because they amplify emotions. I'm constantly wanting a thrilling experience.

Adrenaline was rushing and my leg was trembling, but i was enjoying every moment. I had the hugest smile on my face.

My amazing SO and I are staying at her parent place for a while.  Over the last week I’ve noticed a distinct shortage of available clean boxer shorts, which is strange because the SO does laundry regularly.   Thinking that my SO must have thrown a couple of pairs away due to their age/holes etc , I ordered a couple of new packs and thought nothing else of it until last night......

It’s summer here so we’ve all been dining together on the patio in the rear garden for the last week or so, and last night  was no exception.  After returning from work last night and exchanging pleasantries with the in-laws and helping my SO in the kitchen, I walked out the patio doors into the garden to take my normal seat at the table.    They have a beautiful walled garden, it’s very private and if no one is talking the only thing you can hear are the birds tweeting, a perfect spot to chill out and relax.   Whilst waiting for everyone to finish preparing for dinner I sat back and surveyed the garden, noticing the change to the flowers the warm weather has brought, listening to the birds chirping in the trees, finally getting to take a breath after another taxing day in the office. My attention was suddenly drawn to something hanging on the rotary clothes dryer, my father-in-law had done his laundry that day and hanged his clothes on it to dry in the summer air.   Focusing in on the various item of clothing I noticed a pair of my black boxer shorts hanging there in the evening sunlight. There’s no mistaking they’re my boxer shorts, due to my sizeable man bits I wear supportive Lycra Cotton blend mix type, made by a brand with a distinctive name printed into the waist band. 

All through dinner and the couple of hours after whilst we sat around chatting I had to use every bit of energy I had left in order to hold in the chuckles and to stop myself from staring at my hanging boxer shorts, wishing that I would notice something one them that would make me doubt they actually belonged to me.    Although I initially the thought of the father-in-law happily walking  around with his junk secured in a pair of my boxer shorts was weird, it became very very amusing. 

Anyway,  once my SO and I retired to the bedroom I asked her if she had noticed my boxer shorts hanging with her father laundry, she had, she found it as funny as I did.  She’s done laundry for him lots of times before and knows that he doesn’t wear the same type or brand as I do.  She surmised that on his route from the kitchen in the morning after making breakfast, her father must be  grabbing pairs of my boxer shorts to wear that day off of the clothes drying rails which she stands in the dining room overnight if the laundry hasn’t  dried properly outside during the day.

I’m writing this on my commute into work and my SO has just messaged me to let me know that whilst watering the garden this morning she has noticed another pair of my boxer shorts hanging in the mix of her fathers laundry (he didn’t bother taking the laundry off the line after dinner last night).

I don’t mind at all about loosing boxer shorts, I just don’t know how I’m ever going to be able to look my father in law in the eye again knowing that there’s a chance that his junk is being snuggled by a pair of my boxer shorts.

&lt;p&gt;My amazing SO and I are staying at her parent place for a while.  Over the last week I’ve noticed a distinct shortage of available clean boxer shorts, which is strange because the SO does laundry regularly.   Thinking that my SO must have thrown a couple of pairs away due to their age/holes etc , I ordered a couple of new packs and thought nothing else of it until last night......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s summer here so we’ve all been dining together on the patio in the rear garden for the last week or so, and last night  was no exception.  After returning from work last night and exchanging pleasantries with the in-laws and helping my SO in the kitchen, I walked out the patio doors into the garden to take my normal seat at the table.    They have a beautiful walled garden, it’s very private and if no one is talking the only thing you can hear are the birds tweeting, a perfect spot to chill out and relax.

2 years ago during the cold season I made this shack that had no heater or electricity just 4 walls, a roof, and floor. I put blankets and a sponge in there for anyone who was drunk or didn't have anywhere to go.
Every now and again I would find someone sleeping there and when I did I put a glass of water and something to eat.

Using legal action was not enough, these people deserved hell for what they have done. Since the cults have given me lots financial artillery to work with I put my plan into motion.


Some of the things that happened include:

1. Send spies and private investigators over to check them out for many hours on end.

2. At night my men would throw bricks - break in and sometimes assault them, but this was pretty rare.

3. They would get assaulted by a mob when they would be on a secluded area in the public.

AND after all of that they'd get hit with countless lawsuits due to a breaking of a contract. Near enough all of these cases were won because the attacks mentioned before were enough to damage their mental health and financial status leading to an easier case on my side.

My new neighbor (not actually my neighbor, she lives down the street) hates me because I am living in her deceased husband's house that she thinks should go to her daughter. She's been harassing my mother (lives on the same street) about it for weeks, she's even taken to doing some pretty vaguely threatening things (setting fires, riding quads in the middle of the night past the house, letting her degenerate kids shoot BB's and actual guns whenever/wherever they want on her property). We live in a pretty woodsy area in a very ""redneck"" type state, so I could excuse all of this behavior, but now she's threatening my dog specifically. I have been told by several people now that if I let my dog near her yard she'll shoot him dead. I know this isn't an empty threat either, this wouldn't be the first time she's shot an animal of ours that has gone into her yard.

Indeed, if that even matters, it bothers me a lot. I live in a country where it's said to be no place for racism, as miscegenation is the rule. I like it this way, but it's not always true.
Even though I have a somewhat expressive native American blood, my family background is mainly European, ranging from Portuguese to French and Dutch, which ends up getting people to consider me white, by South American standards.

I can't lie and say I was displeased by that, at least not at that moment. 
As I noticed more and more racist situations, some of them disguised as jokes and similar stuff, I started to look at myself and how I faced these issues. I started to notice how disrespectful and hurtful many of those things were, and how people of African descent were not only viewed, but convinced that they were indeed inferior.
I took notice of how prejudicial that was to the whole society.

I guess a little backstory. This is on a throwaway, because even though know one knows my real account i just dont want this tied to me.  I drink alot, and sometimes get into trouble with the law.  Last year was my first and only DUI (which i know is stupid to do) and was told i couldnt drive for a year. after attending a rehab, waiting a year, and proceeding to think everything was good, it wasnt.  I got pulled over and given a operating without valid id.  The DA picked up my case and the night before i met with the DAs assistant to cover my case, i decided to drink (I know im stupid). btw if your still reading this, this story is going somewhere trust me.  So when i meet at the DAs office, he smelled a bit of liquor on me, had me breathalyzed on the spot, i blew over a 0.0 and he said he couldnt take my case because i had alcohol in my system.  

Flash forward thirty min, im drinking at a bus stop and a kind old man sits down a few seats down from me.  no coverstation just waiting for the bus.  finally the bus arrived, and i had never put my bike on the front of a bus before.  this old man who well from now on call M, told me how to do it and was really nice.  while on the bus we began to talk and found him to be a really nice man. i suggested we swap numbers, having had experience with older people and how much they appreciate just being able to talk to someone. he agreed and we parted ways.

over the next two days M texted me a few times, and to be polite i texted back.  he even called me when i was quite inebriated, and we talked for at least an hour just about life and life experiences.  at the end of the call he suggested we get together for a beer the following day.  i thought nothing of it and say ok.

Again we flash forward to saturday night, i have known M only through phone and one meeting in public.  i admit i had been drinking, but to my past ability and knowledge was no where near blacked out.  I rode my bike down to where we orignally met, and asked if we could just go to his apt builiding lounge area.  red flag number one, he said no there are cameras everywhere.  So i suggest a park thats literally maybe a hundred yards away, we walk over, i even help with his walker, and we sit and drink for a bit.  The next red flag was him constantly saying there were cop cars going by and being nervous.  i didnt catch on why, thought maybe he had prior drinking in publics or something.  

Then shit gets weird, i dont really black out but i dont remeber much either.  I remember him talking about bisexual and gay experiences.  I was pretty out of it, but straight as they come.  I then kinda black out for a minute or two, maybe black out isnt the right word.  I froze. I couldnt move.  I have read about it from sexual assault victims, and often thought why cant you just get up and run.  So as im frozen there he begins to rub my belly, and go down on me.  I am unsure of what to do or what is happening at this point.  

THANK THE LORD, i am not a religious man, but thank you.  Two cops rolled by and he got up to run away.  I was still pretty out of it, but managed to say i think i was sexually assaulted.  they tracked him down, took me to the ER, took DNA.  and here we are. Days later, i cant sleep. i am having panic attacks, i can bareley leave my apartment.  

Heres the real kicker.  They sent the DNA to the crime lab in the state i live, of which there are two.  So in order for them to place a charge on M, his DNA has to match what was taken from me.  After talking to the DA, the Sherriff, and the state crime lab, this could be weeks or months til a charge is made.  and then if there is no plea deal, up to two years for a jury trial.  The last kicker, i want to be a forenic geneticist.  If i was given both types of DNA, access to my universities lab, in 24 hrs i could have probable cause on this guy,

They dim the lights, light some candles and some incense and started playing some romantic music. Oooh Lah Lah.

Stacy has the tightest curves of any woman Chad has ever been with. She had a beautiful, picture-perfect hourglass figure with large titties and a tight ass. 

Chad was the muscular type. He had thick, tight, rock-hard muscles with the perfect texture. His bulge is massive and will leave any woman dripping with excitement.

Chad lays on top of Stacy as they begin to make out. The mood is set and it's getting good. They begin to strip themselves of their clothing. They are now fully naked and are ready for what's about to come next (hehehe ""come"").

Stacy positions herself beside Chad and grips his massive cock with her two small hands. She rubs it up and down for a good 45 seconds before his cock starts to become red.

Here comes the best part (hehehe ""come"")

Stacy positions herself in the reverse cowgirl position for vaginal penetration. Chad's massive cock is then inserted into Stacy's tight vagina and start fucking. They're fucking now, if you haven't realized it yet. 

After about 1 minute, they stop fucking and Chad's cock is twitching now. He's trying his hardest not to cum. Stacy's pussy is already dripping wet. 

The anal sex part now begins. Chad inserts his cock in Stacy's asshole, but couldn't last for much longer.

As he reaches orgasm, Shrek lets out a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love.

W-wait, I meant Chad just fucking came in her ass (hehehe ""came""). As he pulls out, Chad realizes his cock was too large and prolapses Stacy's anus as he violently pulls out. Both are screaming in pain.

And this is the part where I cum (hehehe ""cum"").

Well, you’re not alone. In the year of our lord 2015, I, a small child, asked my mother to purchase Minecraft for me.

I don’t remember exactly what went down, but basically I thought I had wasted $25 on Minecraft. I then relayed this information to my dear mother and older brother. For which I was promptly scolded on asking for help. As of yesterday I found myself again wishing to partake in the glory of Minecraft (mostly to play with my discord friends). So, again I approached my dear mother to ask, no, beg for Minecraft for the second time. She agreed on the conditions that I did extra chores, to which I humbly obliged.

My beloved Minecraft that I had devoted hours upon hours of YouTube watch-time to was somehow skewed. After about ten minutes of google searches I realized why. You see, the ultimate form of Minecraft is known as “Java Edition” which is available for PC and Mac. I had wrongly assumed that this is what the Microsoft home-screen short cut led to. It was not. In actuality, it led to “Windows 10 Edition Beta”, which is a limited version of my beloved Java. So, distraught, I did some digging and found myself at the Minecraft: Official Site Log In page. I decided “Why not?¯\\_(ツ)_/¯” and typed in my old email and password from all this years ago. And, lo and behold, the account was there. I owned Minecraft Java Edition and it had been sitting here waiting for me all these years. I was overjoyed! But then a felt a sinking feeling in my stomach as I flashed back to yesterday, when I specifically remembered reading “no refunds” right before purchasing Windows 10 version. “Dammit,” I said in that moment, “all these years I could’ve been playing Minecraft.” And now my mom really did waste money on Minecraft, but it wasn’t the first purchase...it was the second.

It all started 2 weeks ago when my friend (let's call him P) made a JOKE fanfic about E and R and it was an ARG for us to solve. As I did solve the first one, it was just a start of a fanfic, rest was just simply a joke saying ""YOU THINK I'LL FINISH THIS"" etc etc. We all laughed at it, E got kinda embarassed but she laughed anyways. It all started when he released the 2nd ARG joke fanfic, where R got really pissed off and banned P and (Let's call another friend  of mine B) because they both were involved into making it. It all happened during the night (Since different timezones it was 4 AM for me) after that I went to sleep. After I woke up I saw shit ton of messages flooding my phone saying ""Why was I banned"" and I went to talk with R and that's how it all started. He said that ""He was sick of their shit"" and how ""E and his relationship was a serious thing"" and ""They were bothering him for 8 months straight"". I never saw anything like that happen, since it was just jokes n shit. After that P and B made an alternative channel on disc where we would discuss his intends with other friends. Another friend of ours, (lets call him A) got messsages where he would verbally abuse E and manipulate her into sending him nudes of her. SHE WAS 15. 15 WHILE THAT GUY IS 21. We were shooked, so we decided to pull his IP (B was a IT student so he got few tricks up his sleeve to what to do with it). After we were discussing, E was invited and she said that she's kicking us out of a group that we've worked on (Sort of a game project) because R told her that he doesn't trust her. She said that she'll get us back as soon as possible, but I'm sure that wouldn't happen soon. After this, we invited more close friends to discuss it, and as it finds out, he had most of her personal info.

He had a very different upbringing than I did and wound up engaged to someone else from a similar background shortly afterwards.

I also only applied to schools on the other side of the country (To get away from him? To restart my life? I don't even know). I told him which one I was planning on going to. Shortly after he moved to that city with his new girlfriend. So I accepted an offer from a school a couple hours away from there instead.

But I actually wound up going to law school via the plot of Legally Blonde. He dumped me because &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not the kind of girl you settle down with&amp;quot;. I grew up in poverty, am quite a bit younger than him and was directionless at the time. He had a very different upbringing than I did and wound up engaged to someone else from a similar background shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also only applied to schools on the other side of the country (To get away from him? To restart my life? I don&amp;#39;t even know). I told him which one I was planning on going to. Shortly after he moved to that city with his new girlfriend. So I accepted an offer from a school a couple hours away from there instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So here’s my confession:

I was 11 years old when we met. 

It was the middle of the night, I woke up with a heavy breath quickly realizing that I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed from my head down, I couldn’t even make a sound. But my eyes could gaze the room to see him standing there at the end of my bed looking over me as I lay lifeless. He walked over to my side, got on top of me and with all of his darkness, he suffocated me. I thought I was going to die.  

I would soon wake again but this time it was real, kicking and screaming with tears in my eyes. I ran to my parents room frightened, I slept with them that night. 

That was 17 years ago. 

Ever since, I’ve grown a familiarity with this thing. 7 years ago it started raping me. At first it was very dark and painful. I could experience every sensation of being whipped, choked and stretched. I would be laying in bed or on the couch and it would enter the room and torture me. 

One day that changed, I learned to keep calm, control my breathing and scan the room for a sign, a discrepancy in my environment that would tell me I was sleeping. In the beginning of this practice I would fall straight into reality, a welcomed cure. However in the past 4 years I’ve been using this technique to stay in sleep paralysis and build a bond with my sleep demon. I’ve learned to accept his presence and even control some motor functions while in this state. 

What has resulted is a very intimate and exciting experience with it. I’ve experienced completely lucid, full body orgasms and every stroke of his demon dick feels completely present and real, I may not ever experience sex this good with a real human and I honestly look forward to it now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes it already sounds like I’m completely off the rail, doesn&amp;#39;t it?

Masturbation material was a rare commodity.  
This was in the dark ages, before smart phones and all that.  
Mom didn't even have a TV.  

Wandering around the living room trying to not be bored and noticed two cupboards built into the wall.  
I opened them up and they were empty except for a big full sized photo album.  
I'm thinking, ""score! pics of our family I probably haven't seen in ages, if ever.""  

Opened the album and there they were:  Several pics displayed on two pages.  
I recognized instantly it was my mom.  
In the pics she was my age.  
And OMG, what is going on in these pics?!  
I couldn't look away.  
She was butt naked, tied at the wrists over her head to the top of the bed.  
The camera angle made the center of the photo her glistening red vag in full flash bulb glory.  
In every pic her face looked the same, expressionless but looking at the camera.

Then I started getting the weirdest boner ever.  
The house was deserted.  
No one around for miles.  
I just busted a quick one.  
I wasn't thinking like it's my mom though.  
I was just looking at that sex.  
That body.  
That girl was definitely not my mom.  
Not as long as I didn't look at the face.  
And boom.
It was done.  

Guiltiest feeling ever.  

Or so I thought.  

I put the album back exactly how I'd found it.  

And tried to put the whole thing out of my mind.  

Decades later mom comes to me one night.  
Tells me a story from before I was born. 
Dad asked her if it was okay if he tied her up.
She agreed.  
He did her up, and then pulled out a camera.

I suffer with anxiety in a bad way, and have for most of my teenage and adult life. What I say about in my title, I have made that same mistake again and again throughout my life to deal with the anxiety of not feeling good enough, that other people were going to take my love away from me, or that I wasn't getting enough attention. My anxieties also caused me to act out in a way that caused me to lose my job. I had an affair with an ex colleague on and off for 6 months. I'm not proud of it. All I was doing was trying to satisfy what anxiety was making me feel, rather than facing it and changing my way.

Just recently my partner broke up with me after she caught me flirting someone online. I never wanted to feel this way but sometimes when I am alone, I feel anxious to be loved. But I tried to cover this up with trying to gain the attention I felt I needed and then fought off accusations with anger and sometimes violence. I never wanted to be this person and I hate the anxiety I feel, I just want it all go do away. Sometimes I wish I was dead so I didn't have to deal with it. 

I want to say I'm sorry, sorry for playing to my anxieties and wearing a mask to cover up how useless of a partner I was. I never wanted to feel like I was to blame, and I was so ashamed of what I did I fought against the judgement I received. When my partner broke up with me, before she left for good, I was in turmoil. I kept switching from begging to being angry and back again over and over. I couldn't make sense of my emotions. I wanted to be sorry but I kept nitpicking at little things she did which were of no consequence and didn't mean a thing. I was looking for ways to keep her with me, which was wrong. I should have just let her go.

I'm trying to work out a way to apologise and make things better again. I want to be understood that my anxieties are not the real me, even though they have overshadowed the good times we had together. When I was me, things were great and we had a lot of fun, but as soon as my anxieties hit, things would take a turn downwards. 

She gave me so much, loved me more than anything I have ever felt, and I ruined it all because I couldn't control my emotions, and I played to them to shut them up rather than challenging them to allow me to be a better person. I am currently seeking mental health support, and have be prescribed some anti depressants to try to level me out. But right now I am close to homelessness. With her gone, I don't have enough money to keep our house, or my car. I only have the possessions that surround me. I can't life with my parents due to having a criminal record because of an incident between my ex and me, and their insurance wont cover that. My whole life is falling down around me, because of my mistakes.

I am at a loss as to what to do. The only feeling I can focus on is the love I truly feel for my ex. I want to show her I am sorry, and I want to make things right again. I want to be that good person I know I can be when my anxieties don't define me. I just want her to understand I am working to be that better person.

I once slapped her bf cause he tried to kiss me thinking I was her! We are close now and talk on the phone every single day. What’s cool is that our daughters look like sisters and are often mistaken for siblings. We do have a psychic connection. She always knew when I was pregnant and vise versa. Pretty cool stuff.  Maybe if the stupid teachers at school had not accused us of cheating on tests even though we were not even in the same classes! LOL. Anyone ever have that happen to them?&lt;/p&gt;

So we met in this hotel room and after a few minutes of nervousness, things actually were surprisingly nice. She seemed nice and pretty. I busted out a bag of Ketamine, and we did a few lines. One thing lead to another, and we had sex.  I used a condom. After we were done having sex, I started talking about how there was no universe where I could have a baby. She told me that she would do anything to be a mommy and that was her goal was to get pregnant.

Even though I used a condom, we've all heard the horror stories...and I couldnt bear to have even a shred of possibility that my life would be ruined by this random mountain girl having my baby.

The next day she had to go to school for a few hours (community college). I waited until she left and I saw her pulling out of the motel parking lot. After waiting another 5 minutes, I sprang into action. I googled the nearest drug store, and I got a Plan B pill. I took it back and crushed it on the dresser we were using. When she returned from class, you better bet that she took a huge fat line of Plan B straight to the face. She commented that it felt funny, but I distracted her with more lines of real Ketamine and it was soon forgotten.

07-02-2019

The room is cold. I was cutting out a template for a project I was working on when all of a sudden a crying spell came over me(I’m on my period so a little more emotional than usual). I put my head down on the desk with an x-acto knife still in my left hand. I tilted to look at my right hand which was palm-face-up and relaxed on the desk. I looked at it with no intention. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through the blur of my tears and tear-dried stains on my glasses I began to study my hand. I looked at the tip of my index finger, this time with intention. The most bizarre thought of marrying the knife to the tip of my finger came to mind and nothing kept me from dismissing the idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, just a couple curious pokes with the tiny blunt end. No pain, no pierce. I laid the entire sharp edge of the knife on the tip of my finger and sawed back and forth lightly. No pain nor pierce, but this time a dent. While still crying and observing what I was doing, I laughed at myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

“This is stupid and immature” I questioned what I was doing but didn’t stop

&amp;#x200B;

I sawed harder and felt the first pierce on my skin. This triggered another laugh. I put the knife down and it rolled to the edge of the table. I sat up and stared at my finger; a beautiful bead of blood formed. I felt okay. I knew what I was doing was completely wrong but I felt that rush of adrenaline and it made me feel okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked down this time at my thigh and smiled. I’m making it sound eerie, but I was really just laughing at myself for feeling so good after doing something so stupid. I cut my thigh about four inches away from my stomach and learned that the skin here cuts easier. Maybe because I’m cold? I figured it to be that the goosebumps tensed my skin enough to make it more easily sliceable. I took a break from my handy work to google “why does cutting myself feel good?”. After a bit of reading and more laughing I continued to cut. A total of 10 cuts. All different shapes and sizes and depths. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about my mom who was walking around in the house putting things up, and my niece either in her room or on the couch watching YouTube. I would never want them to know I did this and I’m glad it’s in a place where they can’t see. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone needs to be alleviated: I left a voicemail to schedule my first appointment with a Psych Nurse Practitioner this morning. I’m waiting to hear back from them so no worries; I’ll be okay. For now I think I'll wrap the x-acto knife's tip in some tape and throw it over my fence. I’m really fighting the urge to continue cutting but there’s a part of me still intact enough that knows I shouldn’t and that doesn’t want to. I don’t usually like to litter either but something about tossing it this way feel symbolic; I’m just totally not myself tonight. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Descriptive explanation of my first experience cutting myself. Once on my finger and 10 times on my thigh. I will be meeting with a mental health specialist soon. Going to get rid of the knife before I post this; still fighting the urge to cut more but I’ll be okay.

I've known for a long time that I can't help myself when lying, I can't exactly pin point the age where I began to lie pathologically, I just know from a young age I've told lies. For as long as I can remember I have always lied to everyone around me about a number of different things and though it felt it started off as me innocently trying to protect myself it has now developed into very severe habit I can't break.

**A bit of background on me:**

I won't go into too my much detail but I grew up in a very poor, dysfunctional family. My narcissistic father was violent and abusive towards my mother both physically and emotionally and took every bit of money we had and left us with barely anything to survive on, whilst he would travel the world and do whatever he wanted. He was abusive towards my mother for 16 years and this affected her mentally and she was diagnosed with depression when I was quite young although she refused to take any medication which I think caused her to be extremely unstable and difficult to be around. At times my mother did care for me and did everything to look after me but she was also very violent towards to me and she would have violent outbursts several times a week. Some of my worst memories are of times where she was so violent and I thought she could have it in herself to one day kill me accidentally in a fit of rage.

We ended up moving around a lot, living in really small and run down apartments barely affording the rent and very often struggling to make ends meet. My childhood was spent in a lot of stress and I developed OCD and anxiety around the age of 8 which I still struggle with daily.

The first memory I have of lying is at school, when I was around 6 years old, I would lie to people about where my father was and what he worked as. As my father was absent from my family home a lot of the times, relatives and friends would ask where he was and my mother told everyone he was working abroad a lot and so I continued this lie and told it to everyone I knew. During my time at school, other classmates would ask me to come round to the house or ask to come to my house and I had to reject every time and create an excuse or lie that was believable. If I had gone round to their house I would've eventually had to invite them to mine so I made up lies to act like I was busy a lot of time, way too busy to be able to meet up with anyone from my class outside of school. There were times where other parents of my friends at school would ask my mother if I could go around their house but my mother would make a lie in front of me to them and I then had to continue that lie throughout my time at school. I moved around and so I didn't stay at certain schools long enough to develop a close circle of friends and I constantly had to make up lies at every school I went to as to where I lived, why I moved around a lot and who I was. This grew to a point where at 12 years I recognised I was lying uncontrollably and sometimes didn't realise the lies I was saying until after they had came out of my mouth.

Through all my teenage years I met a lot of different people and I always lied to them about very insignificant things and as I never used to feel bad about it I just continued doing so. I was a high achiever at school and college and I worked hard to achieve good grades which allowed me to secure a place at a top university. I am now 26, I earn a good amount of money and I'm now in a fairly comfortable position in my life. I still cannot control when I lie and I have lied to everyone I know at several different points in my life. There are times I will go to work and someone will ask what I did on the weekend or what I had for breakfast and without realising I will start to tell a lie and then I have to continue and build off it further and then make sure to remember I've said in case anyone else asks. I have lied to my girlfriend about several very serious things in my life, she knows the truth about my childhood but I have also fabricated other things in my childhood that never happened and told detailed stories about them to her on many occasions. When I visit friends I find myself lying to them about so many things that I have began to lose track of them and I have had to act on the spot several times when I potentially am about to get caught out.

I am at a point now where I am consciously trying to stop myself from lying because of the stress it causes me having to maintain more lies and the fear of getting caught out because it is hard to keep track of them all. The weird thing is, I do not at all feel bad for lying to the people I care about most. Whether they are serious lies like knowing someone who has died or something as small as what I did last weekend, I just don't feel any guilt for it at all. It's weird because if someone close to me lies to me I feel so betrayed and feel like I can't trust them but then I constantly lie to everyone around me and don't feel a single bit of guilt at all.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account because some of my close friends use reddit and if they knew this about me they would stop being friends with me in an instant.

We dated for three years, and although she loved me like crazy, I never really loved her at all. The reasons for that are a different story.

About 2.5 years into the relationship, we found out she was pregnant. I didn’t use a condom once and that’s it. After about 6-7 months, we found out that she has a damaged reproductive system, and she had to stay in the hospital.

I would bring her food and stuff every day after work and basically live in that hospital for 2 weeks. She wasn’t allowed to get up or anything. I was by her side through the whole thing.

One day out of nowhere, her water broke. She was about to deliver the baby when we talked to some of the hospital staff. They explained that since she was being delivered at that point, she hasn’t developed lungs yet, and if we decided to let the hospital staff resuscitate her, she could have permanent brain damage. We decided that if she is born and she is not breathing, we would not resuscitate her.

Here’s the fucked up part. This entire time from the point I found out she was pregnant, I was hoping that something bad would happen so that I wouldn’t be stuck in this relationship and life forever. I started praying that if there was a god, he would get me out of this situation.

When the baby was born, I watched her turn blue, then purple, then black right in front of me. I watched in horror as she struggled to breathe without lungs. It was and still is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen.

I’ve lived with this secret my entire life. Ive never told a single person. It has given me depression to the point where I’ve tried to commit suicide, incredible anxiety, and nightmares that I’ve had ever sense. I’ve been through mental hospitals and therapists as well.

It was the spring of our freshman year of college.

My roommate Nate and I had this weird vibe between us. We were always competing over everything, but we are also always drunk. I suppose college is always like that, but I think we were worse than the majority of people. We were definitely well into alcoholism for sure. There were a lot of nights that I only remember bits and pieces of.

Nate and I were always trying to outdo each other. If Nate did a shot I felt like I had to do two, and then he'd do a third one just to beat me. I was an Economics student, and he was studying Political Science. We both went into the school without any friends, and living together we became close pretty quickly. It was more like a mutually reenforced downward spiral than a long lasting friendship.

We became well-known attendees to all the parties. Our ongoing contest was always trying to outdo each other so that we could collect the most outlandish stories and experiences that we could tell to other people later on.

Most of it was completely juvenile- streaking, getting drunk and passing out naked in our neighbor's yard, shaving people's heads while they were asleep, stuff like that. It was always a good way to blow off steam after midterms.

On the surface of it, we were just too happy go lucky college students, with our whole lives ahead of us, but everything changed that Spring.

I'm a bit ashamed of this, but all of those parties were way out in the suburbs, the only way to get there was by driving, and in those days, we didn't think anything about driving home drunk. In fact, it was extra bragging rights in our ongoing ""stupidest shit you've ever done"" contest the time Nate woke up in the front seat of his car parked in his driveway.

This particular night, I remember we intended to go really hard. I brought a handle of vodka and a four pack of red bull to the party in the same backpack that I had used in high school. Looking back on it now, I'm just so ashamed. We were basically boys and we didn't know any better.

I spent the whole night talking to this girl named Jessica trying to hook up, which was a mistake because her friend dragged her away. Nate was playing smash Bros with some other guys until well into the night. Finally I convinced him that we should go.

Now here's the fucked up part. we're driving around in the middle of suburbia on some unfamiliar street at like 3:00 a.m. I'm basically dozing off hoping to wake up at home, when I'm shaken awake by a massive explosion.

It's all kind of hazy from the adrenaline. I remember being stunned as Nate popped the driver side door open. He was just repeating, ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.""

As I got out of the car, I got a better view. There was a guy sprawled out on the street. We had hit him with such force that we threw him back about 10 feet. He looked like he landed in a really wrong position. His neck was at an unnatural angle, and he was still twitching involuntarily, a tiny bit.

""What do we do?""

""Call 911.""

""I'm fucking drunk What am I supposed to do? You can blow clean right? Can we tell them you were driving?""

""No fucking way."" I shook my head vigorously. ""You killed him you fucking idiot!""

I reach down and touched his neck. I remember almost gagging at the smell coming off of him. I saw his tattered jacket and the bag of bottles and cans next to him on the road, and I realized that he was a hobo. There was no pulse by that point. I wiped my two fingers on my pants where I had touched this neck. They just felt dirty, and I felt a massive hole forming in The bottom of my stomach. I remember remarking on how little blood there was- just some scrapes on his elbow.

""We need to get out of here, right now! Get in the car.""

I really wanted to be brave. I wanted to protest, but I didn't say anything. I just didn't know what to do. My whole life was just over in a flash. I was going to go to prison.

We both knew that our only chance of living a normal life was just to leave him there. For the first time, I looked behind us at the empty stretch of road on the other side of the car. No one had witnessed our accident.

I know I'm a coward. You don't have to tell me. I got in the car. Nate peeled out, and we accelerated away. We did the rest of the drive back in complete silence.

Nate and I never mentioned the incident to one another again. Those who knew us really well wondered why we both seemed so depressed for the rest of that year.

Every night, I went to bed expecting to wake up to police banging on our door, but it never came. I obsessively bought the local paper to follow the story, but there was only ever a single paragraph article, something like ""Transient struck by car in hit and run- no leads.""

I think about it every day. Even my wife doesn't know. When I close my eyes, I can still remember with perfect clarity the guy's face, with his neck at that unnatural angle, and his mouth agape.

Nate died a couple years back of a heroin overdose. Sometimes I wonder if it was guilt that forced him deeper into that downward spiral. That makes me the only living person to remember this event, so it will truly die with me.

Sometimes my wife asks me why I can't sleep at night. I tell her it's just my nerves. It's a lot simpler this way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember it so clearly. It was the spring of our freshman year of college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it was completely juvenile- streaking, getting drunk and passing out naked in our neighbor&amp;#39;s yard, shaving people&amp;#39;s heads while they were asleep, stuff like that. It was always a good way to blow off steam after midterms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface of it, we were just too happy go lucky college students, with our whole lives ahead of us, but everything changed that Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit ashamed of this, but all of those parties were way out in the suburbs, the only way to get there was by driving, and in those days, we didn&amp;#39;t think anything about driving home drunk. In fact, it was extra bragging rights in our ongoing &amp;quot;stupidest shit you&amp;#39;ve ever done&amp;quot; contest the time Nate woke up in the front seat of his car parked in his driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular night, I remember we intended to go really hard. I brought a handle of vodka and a four pack of red bull to the party in the same backpack that I had used in high school. Looking back on it now, I&amp;#39;m just so ashamed. We were basically boys and we didn&amp;#39;t know any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the whole night talking to this girl named Jessica trying to hook up, which was a mistake because her friend dragged her away. Nate was playing smash Bros with some other guys until well into the night. Finally I convinced him that we should go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the fucked up part. we&amp;#39;re driving around in the middle of suburbia on some unfamiliar street at like 3:00 a.m. I&amp;#39;m basically dozing off hoping to wake up at home, when I&amp;#39;m shaken awake by a massive explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all kind of hazy from the adrenaline. I remember being stunned as Nate popped the driver side door open. He was just repeating, &amp;quot;oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got out of the car, I got a better view. There was a guy sprawled out on the street. We had hit him with such force that we threw him back about 10 feet. He looked like he landed in a really wrong position. His neck was at an unnatural angle, and he was still twitching involuntarily, a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do we do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Call 911.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fucking drunk What am I supposed to do? You can blow clean right? Can we tell them you were driving?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No fucking way.&amp;quot; I shook my head vigorously. &amp;quot;You killed him you fucking idiot!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reach down and touched his neck. I remember almost gagging at the smell coming off of him. I saw his tattered jacket and the bag of bottles and cans next to him on the road, and I realized that he was a hobo. There was no pulse by that point. I wiped my two fingers on my pants where I had touched this neck. They just felt dirty, and I felt a massive hole forming in The bottom of my stomach. I remember remarking on how little blood there was- just some scrapes on his elbow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need to get out of here, right now! Get in the car.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be brave. I wanted to protest, but I didn&amp;#39;t say anything. I just didn&amp;#39;t know what to do. My whole life was just over in a flash. I was going to go to prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both knew that our only chance of living a normal life was just to leave him there. For the first time, I looked behind us at the empty stretch of road on the other side of the car. No one had witnessed our accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;m a coward. You don&amp;#39;t have to tell me. I got in the car. Nate peeled out, and we accelerated away. We did the rest of the drive back in complete silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nate and I never mentioned the incident to one another again. Those who knew us really well wondered why we both seemed so depressed for the rest of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every night, I went to bed expecting to wake up to police banging on our door, but it never came. I obsessively bought the local paper to follow the story, but there was only ever a single paragraph article, something like &amp;quot;Transient struck by car in hit and run- no leads.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about it every day. Even my wife doesn&amp;#39;t know. When I close my eyes, I can still remember with perfect clarity the guy&amp;#39;s face, with his neck at that unnatural angle, and his mouth agape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nate died a couple years back of a heroin overdose. Sometimes I wonder if it was guilt that forced him deeper into that downward spiral. That makes me the only living person to remember this event, so it will truly die with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes my wife asks me why I can&amp;#39;t sleep at night. I tell her it&amp;#39;s just my nerves. It&amp;#39;s a lot simpler this way.&lt;/p&gt;

This happend a few days ago an though it’s not a terrible secret, I’m still quite ashamed and haven’t told anyone.

I had to do Some grocerie shopping and parked the car in front of the store, then went to take a shopping cart. Now this is a shop where you can scan the groceries yourself if you scan a customer card first. Looking for the card I notice I forgot my wallet, so I need to go back home to pick it up, however, when I get back to the car, I cannot find my keys ANYWHERE.
I look in my bag, in every compartment and on the ground, under the racks of flowers, in my shopping bag... 
it’s gone.
I’m guessing that it is in the shopping cart, I must have thrown it in when I threw my shopping bag in and someone in the store must now have my keys in their cart.
So i ask one of the shop employees to make an announcement to ask people to check their carts. 
Nobody shows up and I wait for over an hour hoping that someone will find my key, nobody does. At that time I’m almost crying and checking my bag around 43 times, never finding them. I call my daughter to ask her to bring the spare keys (then realise I don’t know where I put them) I call my husband like 15 times because he doesn’t pick up, also call the people he is with, who also don’t pick up (Jay for mobile phones!) 

Until I realise that there is a make-up bag in my purse which I díd check, but realise I did not check the side compartment.

I ended up staying there a couple nights over the course of my father and stepmother's relationship.

While I could go on and spill some traumatic events that involved my step sister and her mother, that will be for another time.

At my then step sister's apartment, she, her junkie boyfriend, and my niece and nephew lived on the 2nd floor, and there was a family below them. That family consisted of three daughters, a mother, and the father.

At one point my step sister casually tells me that the father hits the daughters and yells at them day in and day out. Baffled, and angered, I asked why she hadn't contacted the police. I don't remember if I even got a straight answer.

At one point some of the daughters came upstairs to visit/play with my niece and nephew. I remember the youngest being about 4, and the oldest being maybe a year or two younger than I was at the time. I noticed they loved to play with my nephew, Alex. They would dance with him and sing to him and coddle him, but they wanted nothing to do with my niece Mary, and were actually kind of rude to her. To make Mary not feel so left out I played with her while the daughters played with Alex.

Later on that night everyone in the building (both my step sister's family and the family from downstairs) goes outside to sit around this trashy little makeshift bonfire and smoke cigarettes. I forget what I was doing, or how the fight even got started, but eventually the father became drunk. Incredibly drunk. I was extremely frightened, but the daughters just sat there. They were used to it. I was horrified.

The father starts to rant and rave and eventually starts screaming that he's going to leave the family.

From a young age I had been traumatized by yelling so at this point I was absolutely frozen, not breathing.

As soon as he starts going on and on about leaving the mother ant the three daughters, the mother makes a desparate attempt to cover the youngest daughter's ears and try to tell the father that, right here, in front of all the children and people he doesn't even know, is not the best time for this.

I remember the next part so vividly.

The father's eyes get wide, and he looks at the mother and goes:

"" Oh, no need to hide it."" In an eerily calm voice, then turns to face the daughter whose ears are still being covered by the mother, and screams,

"" I'M LEAVING!""

He them gets up and stumbles to the house.

I think I remember turning to the eldest daughter who was sitting next to me and saying "" I'm so sorry."" To which I believed she shrugged.

Whenever this memory comes up, I can't help but get angry. Angry at the father, angry at the mother of those girls for staying with that monster of a man, angry at my Step sister for just sitting by and let this sort of abuse carry on under her feet.

And I feel guilty most of all. I could've done something, but as a child myself I had the notion that my voice didn't matter (part of the home life I experienced rewarded me with that mindset) and I knew I was a visitor in my Step Sister's home, so I did not have enough evidence to prove anything...

I was in college and hade a 4 bedroom apartment styled dorm to myself. At the time I was only 18 and had just gone through my first really bad break up. It messed me up pretty badly and I didn’t know how to cope. All my friends weren’t talking to me so I couldn’t get any advice. I decided that I would date around thinking it could take my mind off the break up and help me move on and also have some company finally. I went on a few dates with a few different guys. Nothing ever happened and they were all basically the same, all looking for just sex and I got fed up pretty fast (also I put on my profile that I wasn’t looking for any of that ). One day I received a message on the dating app I was using. It was from a guy named Lars, cool name and what not. I don’t remember swiping right on him, but he looked clean cut and was about 24 and had already graduated college and was working his profession already. I liked that and started talking with him. We eventually set up a day to meet and hang out. 

We agreed to meet at my place and watch a movie (Cliché). When the day came, I was a bit nervous. I always was when it came to this sort of thing.  I let him in the main doors and we proceeded to the elevator. He was dressed in a nice sweater and slacks. He looked dapper, more like a dad than a 24 year old yet really young in the face. Approaching my room, I we departed what genre to watch and I vouched for horror to which he agreed. We sat in the living room to watch the fist half but it became uncomfortable and I was kind of feeling attracted to him. I asked if he wanted to watch the rest of it in my room so it would be more comfortable. He agreed and I plopped my lap top on my dresser and sat next to him on the edge of my bed. He seemed really really REALLY stiff, I could tell he was really nervous but I wasn’t sure why. I was sitting a reasonably far distance from him. I said “are you okay? “ he looked at me and replied VERY nervously “ yeah, I just don’t want to do anything wrong”  I looked at him and felt bad and got up to sit in my computer chair to give him more space so he’d feel comfortable. After a while he spoke up, seemingly more confident. “ if you want you can come up and sit next to me?” I did so and he put an arm around me. He was shaking a bit but was more confident. He looked at me and the second I looked at him, he kissed me. I kissed back. I was into him and was lonely so I wasn’t thinking. We started making out for a while and started feeling me up and I did the same to him. There was something off... you know how you can usually feel a bulge on a guy if they’re getting in the mood? I Couldn’t feel on at all. I thought maybe he has it tucked so an awkward boner wouldn’t happen or he’s just not that into it yet. 

We started taking off each other clothes and when it got to taking off underwear, I didn’t want to look. I’m awkward about that sort of thing so I just rolled on my stomach and he got the hint to do it this way. I felt his thing on my butt, BUT it was like really really small. Imagine a Cheeto puff, cut that in half and that was his penis. His balls were the size of a newborns. I felt uncomfortable,( I’d like to mention that the first person I had sex with did not have a big thing, but it was not a micro penis. ) he started to stick it in and I’m not going to lie I literally couldn’t feel anything. He started to push in and out and heave really hard and I finally came to my senses and realized that I had only just met this guy and I was having sex... kind of. I didn’t want to be rude and make him feel self conscious, so I panicked and faked a  asthma attack. He stopped. He seemed agitated. I was so embarrassed and just wanted him to leave.

—————

So here’s some background - Both my parents were born in little towns hidden into mountains, so they had a difficult life (my father had many shortcomings as a kid: he had 11 siblings, the food was in scarce, he barely had any clothes, not to mention no money for school. Meanwhile, my mother had a similar life, although she was brought to the city to work at a very young age so her life wasn’t that bad, but she’s known for keeping grudges so bad) and this shaped their minds into a “traditional family” (You know, no sex at young age, getting married, having kids, etc) 
The core of the story begins here: since I could remember, my mother used to hate a specific music band, more specifically one song. When I asked her about it, she would always cut me out and say that “she would tell me when I was older and understood things better”. I’ve always been a little bit ahead of my age when it comes to maturity issues (not that I’m a sage woman or anything like that, but I did understood life at a certain point). And since I kinda liked that band and song, she would get a little annoyed when I hummed it or listened to it.

I wouldn’t ask to my dad because we weren’t close at that time, and honestly I was only closer to my middle brother, but I just couldn’t ask him before because I was afraid that the deal was bad and I didn’t wanted to put him in a difficult position.

And oh boy, it was bad.

Please note that my middle brother (B) actually told me the story before my mother, because he though I should be prepared and I was ready to know, because it was kinda like a “family secret”.

One day, when I’m around 16 or so, my mom comes to me when I’m minding my business and begins with “so you remember when you use to ask me about the song and why I don’t like it?” And I was like “yeah, what about it?”
So then she tells me this story were they used to live in a little neighborhood with all the 5 of us (my older brother was around 15-16; the middle brother 3 years younger than that and I was 2-3 years old. Here including mom and dad, of course) and also my youngest aunt, let’s call her D for ironical purposes. So we were 6 in a small apartment.

So we all lived there, happy and everything.

My older brother (let’s say M) was usually out of the neighborhood and started wearing kinda expensive clothes and watches and some jewelry. When confronted about it, he said he was fooling around in buses helping the drivers collecting the fee from the passengers, so they would pay him for his help (this way the drivers wouldn’t take their eyes off the road while charging the passengers). My mom seemed satisfied with that response, since it meant that my brother was getting some job responsibility, and not only school, while also earning some money.
In the meantime, D was supposed to be working, so the two of them weren’t at the house that much, but since mom thought M was working on the buses and D had this fancy job, this all seemed fine.

Since you read the title, you can assume what was ACTUALLY happening between D and M.

The thing is that one day my mom is cleaning M’s room, and she found a letter (I’m not sure if she actually found this letter by chance, or if she meddled with M’s stuff) and out of “mother curiosity” she started reading it. This was on a weekend, and both D and M were out “working midday” but my dad and B where in the house chilling. As said, she starts reading and turn out this letter was from D to M, and it said something like:
“I love you so much, my love. I’m so happy to be with you. I’m also really happy that I’m pregnant with your baby, because this get us closer” and similar shit. 
Mom was beyond static, she started crying and screaming, demanding M to come (with no results since he was out with D). Dad and B got scared and asked what was happening, mom immediately demands B to go to his room, and say no word. B, seeing that Mom was beyond furious, decided to shut up and do as mom said, while mom starts yelling what she just read to Dad. Both were extremely surprised, and waited for M to come back and demand an explanation. 

When M came back, the house went bollocks again, mom started yelling at a surprised M, D wasn’t there since she was “out with girlfriends” so M was left alone with the situation. B didn’t even moved a muscle, hearing everything that was happening from the other room. Trying to scape the yelling and some other violence (punches from my mom), M went to the living room and played ‘the song’ to try and suffocate the constant shouting from both mom and dad, hence why the bad memories with the song.

When D came home, the story repeated: yelling, slaps, punches, demands, etc. D left the house because my mom was about to really fight her like a wrestler, so Dad demanded her out. She took some clothes and stayed with a friend.

Things from that point were extremely tense, nobody could even talk properly, and M was grounded to the end. Mom felt betrayed by D, she couldn’t believe D could take advantage from her own nephew at such point, everything was just bad.

Some weeks later, D ask Mom to talk with her, mom wanted to slap her. Dad convince Mom to hear D, out of curiosity, I guess. D then starts to tell this heartbreaking story on how she actually had a brain tumor that messed with her normal behavior, that she was extremely ashamed of her actions, although not rational, still her actions, and that she was undergoing surgery and that she might die, so it would meant the world to her to be forgiven for everything, and that if she could live through it, she would spend her entire life to make everything right.

Mom seemed to believe D and she forgave her. D undergo surgery and she recovered just fine.
Everything went to kind of normal, until my baptizing, months later.

Mom was busy with all the arrangements for the party, so D was helping around, or she was supposed to.
Mom found D and M making out on my room (or  at least I think it was my room) so she lost it again and threw D out of the house, not minding the party.
To be noted that the tumor story was a complete lie, she just wanted back in the house to keep fucking M. She faked the whole thing: scans, surgery, recovery. The whole thing. I think M confessed this when D was threw out of the house, so that’s why mom completely hated her guts. She lied again, so mom was done.

20 years had to pass for my mom to actually “forgave” D (there was some other bad blood between Mom and D regarding my grandparents, but that’s another story), but deep down she’s happy that D finally had a daughter, because then “karma would strike her with her own daughter” (this came by her own mouth) She says she forgave her from her heart of heart, but I don’t believe her. My mom is queen of a land called pasiva-agresiva, she never forgets nor forgives. I also find it pretty hypocritical for her to keep D close, probably she just wants to be close when “karma strikes”.

Forgot to mention that D was NOT pregnant, and the letter was kind of a joke (?), a game. She would act like a young girl to “fit” M’s age to keep him happy.

TL;DR - When my older brother was around 15-16, he started behaving weird and being out of the house. He said he was “working”, but in reality he was having an affair with our aunt D. Mom lost her shit when she found out through a letter D wrote to M, throwing D out of our house.
Weeks later, D ask for forgiveness saying that she had a tumor and might die; Mom forgave her and allowed her back. A few months later, while in a party, Mom found out D and M making out, also discovering that the tumor thing was another lie. Mom finally cut all relationship with D and hated her guts until years later, only because D got pregnant and had a daughter.
My assumption is that Mom only forgave D to be closer to her when “karma strikes back”.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the format, I’m on mobile.

This is deplorable, but I cannot really change it.

It is not pure racism because I am fine with people of all races who live in my country (which isn't even my country by birth, I am an immigrant same as them) as long as they share my basic values. But I have a strong dislike for the majority of people in all the countries collectively known as the 3rd world. I believe that they are very much to blame for their own predicament. Mostly because of their religiosity and resulting over breeding. They love to blame the west for colonization and exploitation but they never look at their exploding populations and their tribalism to explain why things around them are so shitty.

All the awful things that happen are just math. If you feed your family from a small plot of land, just barely enough and then you divide the plot among your 13 kids, who each go on to have 10 kids of their own - you can no longer live off your land. So your 13 kids (who did not receive any kind of education or skills beyond working the plot of land) are headed for the city. It's just math.

It takes a lot to build decent infrastructure for a city of a million people, even in the west, so if the population balloons to 5 million while you are still trying to provide for 1 million - you will have millions of people living in slums with no water or sanitation. It's really not America's fault, it's just math.

If your area draws water from a river, a reservoir or an aquifer that can sustainably support a million people and every family has 10 kids (or 8 kids, or 6 kids, or anything more than 2 kids), a generation later you will be taking out more water than gets naturally replenished and 2 generations later there will be no more water. It's not racism, it's just math.

Every time they show a poor destitute person who doesn't know how to provide for his 14 kids - why the f-ck does he have 14 kids? And what do I have to do with feeding his 14 kids? Who told them it was a good idea to have 14 kids? I never went hungry, but really only because my parents did not have 14 kids. If you are one of the 14 and there is no more land, no jobs, no services and no hope - and you try to make your way into Europe or USA and drown on the way - Trump didn't do it - it's your parents and the priests and imams who preached to them who were very bad at math.

This mind boggling lack of logic and accountability annoys me so much - I enjoy reading about all the disasters striking the 3rd world. I also feel a terrible disconnect from the world on a personal level and it makes me just hate people. I can make an allowance for people around me and all the peoples I feel are ""useful"" - to me, but the rest of them... I've been a news junkie for a long time, and I always told myself that I feel bad for the victims but I realize more and more I have been lying to myself.

About 13 years ago I was in Albany on a engineering course which lasted a few months. I had the time of my life, met some amazing friendly people – especially some ladies !! One of these ladies I have kept constant contact with and supported her to escape a loveless  marriage by give moral support and financial aid too. 

Starting in 2014 I’d manage to get back over there for a week or so and have an wonderful time both in and out of her bed. Six visits in total all wonderful and fulfilling.

Then something happened; prior to may last visit I was overwhelmed with anxiety, almost crippled by it but managed to muster up enough will power travel over there and of course had the usual wonderful time. But I thought after I had returned home that I couldn’t do that again. So never made any plans to go back over, always avoiding the issue when asked by my host. Also the USA seemed to change and I thought if I committed to trying to live in the USA I’d be stopped at the AirPort “Boarder” and be prevented from entering the USA under the visa Waiver Program – then I’d never be able to return, would have given up my own family – the worst of both worlds.

Until I decided to I was plan to try and make one more visit for about a month to see if we could really hit it off and not try and kill each other after that time. Shorts times are great but longer times are more of a guide to haw a long term relationship may pan out. 

At the same time my wife became very ill and my morals wouldn’t then allow me to abandon her so that was the decision made for me by fate – my USA host was in agreement that I should stay with my wife.

So after that we struggled on with iMessages and regular Face Time to enjoy each other’s company and discuss how the world could be a better place. 

It was never really said that I’d not be going over again and eventually we had to have that conversation to make it clear and eventually we both did understand. I did receive some funny looks for crying my face of in a car park that day. I also felt I should apologies for wasting two years and a bit  of her life after my last visit where she could have been finding the right guy.

Then we agreed that she should move on from waiting for me, she should find a nice USA guy of a similar age who she could spend the rest of her life with. There were some Plenty of Fish type dates but these guys seemed to be the type who were to just too lazy to find a hooker and were only interested in a “one off” date, sex, goodbye scenario. Four guys in four weeks took its toll and I literally collapsed with grief at it all. She was ok with what was happening, I could barely handle it or function clearly at work.

So I sent here the money to sign up for a paid dating site and now she has found a guy who may be the one for her.

My trouble is I found myself feeling so much affection for her when the PoF episodes were going on that now I cannot have any peace, my mind works overtime all the time thinking about her and longing to be with her. For the first time in my life I can understand how people can consider ending their lives – feel it would be easier to be dead than go on receiving the pain. When we FT as we still do every day – my heart sings and I miss her so much all the time. Some days I cannot stop the flow of tears and I have no real idea why they are coming – I’m 58 FFS – this is 13YO persons stuff !!

There are many options to consider but all have them have reasons why they cannot be done:

1 Leave my wife – my moral objection to abandoning her after 34 years of marriage.

2 Go the USA anyway  - 1, may not be able to get in the USA, we may not be good together after all, she has a guy now who may be the one so I should stay away.

3 Cut of all contact; no Face book, delete all contact information and block each other – we both can’t bear the thought of breaking contact.

4 Take my life to end the pain – the other half of me wants to live, who would look after my wife, my USA Friend needs me in her life, though eventually she won’t once the right guy becomes established.

Also the USA seemed to change and I thought if I committed to trying to live in the USA I’d be stopped at the AirPort “Boarder” and be prevented from entering the USA under the visa Waiver Program – then I’d never be able to return, would have given up my own family – the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I decided to I was plan to try and make one more visit for about a month to see if we could really hit it off and not try and kill each other after that time. Shorts times are great but longer times are more of a guide to haw a long term relationship may pan out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time my wife became very ill and my morals wouldn’t then allow me to abandon her so that was the decision made for me by fate – my USA host was in agreement that I should stay with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after that we struggled on with iMessages and regular Face Time to enjoy each other’s company and discuss how the world could be a better place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was never really said that I’d not be going over again and eventually we had to have that conversation to make it clear and eventually we both did understand. I did receive some funny looks for crying my face of in a car park that day. I also felt I should apologies for wasting two years and a bit  of her life after my last visit where she could have been finding the right guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we agreed that she should move on from waiting for me, she should find a nice USA guy of a similar age who she could spend the rest of her life with. There were some Plenty of Fish type dates but these guys seemed to be the type who were to just too lazy to find a hooker and were only interested in a “one off” date, sex, goodbye scenario. Four guys in four weeks took its toll and I literally collapsed with grief at it all. She was ok with what was happening, I could barely handle it or function clearly at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sent here the money to sign up for a paid dating site and now she has found a guy who may be the one for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My trouble is I found myself feeling so much affection for her when the PoF episodes were going on that now I cannot have any peace, my mind works overtime all the time thinking about her and longing to be with her. For the first time in my life I can understand how people can consider ending their lives – feel it would be easier to be dead than go on receiving the pain. When we FT as we still do every day – my heart sings and I miss her so much all the time. Some days I cannot stop the flow of tears and I have no real idea why they are coming – I’m 58 FFS – this is 13YO persons stuff !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options to consider but all have them have reasons why they cannot be done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Leave my wife – my moral objection to abandoning her after 34 years of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Go the USA anyway  - 1, may not be able to get in the USA, we may not be good together after all, she has a guy now who may be the one so I should stay away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Cut of all contact; no Face book, delete all contact information and block each other – we both can’t bear the thought of breaking contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Take my life to end the pain – the other half of me wants to live, who would look after my wife, my USA Friend needs me in her life, though eventually she won’t once the right guy becomes established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

The girl I like now (let’s call her Em for simplicity reasons) is my best friend and is the most down-to-earth girl I’ve ever met, unlike most of the other girls at my school. Just under a year ago, I started attending the school Em and I go to, and I was sat next to her in English lessons so we naturally started talking during lessons and then at lunch and break and then after school so I quickly became friends with her. It grew from there as when we finished school about 4 weeks ago, we started going out and having house parties together with other friends and this is the point where I really started to fancy her.

Never before had I felt such a strong attraction towards a girl, since I’m mostly a bit of a nerd who doesn’t get out of the house much, and I never really saw girls outside of school. However this girl is something truly special and I can confidently say I love her. We take loads of photos together and I constantly look back at them to admire her smile (and how fucking cute she is!!!!), to the point where he actually framed a couple photos.

The problem is that she has a boyfriend. Her boyfriend is 18, has a car, his parents are chill, he’s a druggie and he’s not going to university. So he’s basically exactly what I don’t want because at this point it seems like they’re never going to break up, since neither of them has any reason to. The lad always looks at me funny whenever I see him, almost as if he knows she might like me too much (maybe maybe maybe??!!!)

Obviously I want her to be happy, so I don’t want her to break up with her boyfriend, but at the same time I do.

Grrrrrrrrrr at least I got it off my chest. I’ll show you a photo of how gorgeous she is if anyone asks. Cheers.

EDIT: had to revisit because I forgot to mention how happy she makes me. I could literally see her in her car and I have a beaming smile for about 20 minutes. She makes me happier than my doggies when I come home after a long day.

English is not my native language, so I apologize for occasional mistakes.

This story started a few years ago when I was around 16 years old. I grew up in a small town with my brother, mother and father. My father was an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. He wasn’t the abusive kind of alcoholic, but he was an asshole. There just was a lot of fighting and screaming between my mother and him. Thinking about it now, I think he made her cry on a few occasions, but I was too young to understand that. My brother moved out for college when I was around 14 and my mother moved out when I was 16. She moved to another city for a job post because her current job post was shut down. I remember encouraging her to go, to move as far away from my father as possible. On the day she left, I escorted her to the bus station. I didn’t cry, I pretended to be happy for her. Well, I was happy for her, I just wasn’t happy for myself. I remember coming home that day and just crying my soul out. I felt abandoned. I felt as if they all found a happier life without my father in it and they just left me behind because I wasn’t able to go with them. 

After that, I spent two years of my life without any parental figure in my life. My mom would come visit home when she could, but that was only for weekends. She and my father never got an official divorce. I remember those years as some of the most carefree years of my life. I could have done anything I wanted with no restrictions on curfew or anything. I’d rarely see my father even though we lived in the same house. By the time I’d wake up in the morning he was already out of the house, probably drinking somewhere and by the time I’d come home in the evening he was asleep on the couch. For that whole time, I still felt really abandoned, like nobody cared for me, but I tried really hard to just ignore that feeling because I liked the idea of thinking of myself as an adult and as one I shouldn’t have had those feelings. I never told anyone how I felt, and I thought that with time, I’d be able to forgive my mother.

I was planning to move out from my father’s house after I finish high school. I was always a good student and had high grades, so I was planning to enroll in college in another town. Things got complicated a bit though. During my last year of high school, my father got diagnosed with cancer. I had a lot of resentment towards him back then, so I didn’t give much thought to it at the beginning. I remember telling my best friend at some point that I wouldn’t even care if he died. That sentence still troubles me because it was so senseless from me to say that.   
He was officially diagnosed in March 2016 and died in August that same year. Those few months were some of the most difficult months in my life. There were only me and him. My mom would visit, but as I said earlier, only on the weekends. I had to start cooking for us, I had to take him to doctor appointments, I had to shower him etc. I think the most disturbing thing to me was watching him slowly die. I had to watch him grew weak. I watched him lose so much weight, he was just skin and bones in the end. Eventually his voice was nothing more than a whisper. After a while he grew so weak that he wasn’t able to leave bed anymore. Then he started to have a withdraw crisis. I’d sneak him some alcohol to make things easier for him. I think that as the time passed by, he started to realize he was going to die. He grew afraid. He was constantly seeking for my company and I didn’t have the heart to refuse. We started to spend a lot of time together watching the tv or just talking. He talked about his youth and how he made some very wrong decisions in his life. 

After a while he was in so much pain that the doctors started to give him morphine. I remember, once I forgot to remove the old morphine bag from his arm before placing a new one, and I just left him with two bags stuck to his arm. He got so high that day before I realized what happened. He walked in my room all happy because he was in no pain whatsoever and he was able to walk once again. Little did I know that he had a broken hip at the time. He was just so happy.   
I forgot to mention the smell. It was summer, and he was unable to get from the bed so we made him an improvised toilet he could use from bed to pee. The smell of urine in the room was horrible. On a few occasions the container with his urine spilled and that smell stuck to the carpet and the couch. We later had to threw both in the garbage.   
At the beginning of August my friend invited me to stay with her at her vacation house for a few days. I was so stressed out that I had to accept. Just around that time my brother came home and I was able to leave. I came back home after 5 days or so only to find out my father wasn’t there anymore. He was transferred to hospital because of his broken hip I mentioned earlier. I went over to visit him. I really wish I hadn’t. Apparently he wasn’t the same person after the surgery. I remember seeing him on the hospital bed. He had the stare of a madman. He was delusional. He knew who I was, but I don’t think he knew he was sick. He kept saying that they’re poisoning him in that hospital, that they want to kill him. He made me promise I’d call the police. He was unaware he had surgery, so he had to be restrained to bed to prevent him from further injuring himself. I left in shock.   
He died three days later. That was three days before my 19th birthday. He was buried on my 19th birthday. 

I was extremely sad because I formed a nice relationship with him during the last few months. I got to know him as a person, something I have never done before. That feeling of being abandoned came back as well, because I felt I shouldn’t have went through all of that alone. I wanted to talk about him with someone but anytime I’d mention him to my brother or mother they’d just say that they don’t want to talk about it.   
A lot of people passed through my house during the days after my father died. My mom hosted them in the kitchen, while I was usually in my room. I remember hearing her talk about how my brother did a fantastic job taking care of my father and how he took him to the hospital. My brother was there for 2 weeks tops. I never heard her saying anything about me, and it felt so unfair.

Because of all of the things that happened, my mental state got worse. I was constantly paranoid of getting cancer or just dying. I moved to another city for college and that’s when I felt I was all alone. Things got really bad when I wasn’t able to eat anymore because I thought I’d die if I ate to much. I lost around 10kg, and weighted only 46 kg before I realized I had some problems. It took me a great amount of time to realize I was suffering from panic attacks. By the time I realized that I was unable to perform most of the functions in a normal man’s life. I was unable to ride a bus, unable to eat, unable to take a shower and so many other things. I remember thinking to myself on a few occasions that things can’t really get worse than they are now, but I was wrong, they could. Each time I’d find out that I was unable to do some new thing. After a while my mom realized there was something wrong with me, and she forced me to move in with her. This time, she was with me through the whole process. It took me 3 years to get back to normal more or less. I’m still feeling the consequences, but I can once again perform most of my daily activities. I’m doing extremely well at college and I’m thinking about moving out from my mother’s apartment in September. 

The events that happened before and after my father died still trouble me. I think about him quite often and every time I feel the same sadness I felt on the day he died. 

I never told the full story to anyone because, as you can see if you read all of this, the story is quite long and painful.

I’d rarely see my father even though we lived in the same house. By the time I’d wake up in the morning he was already out of the house, probably drinking somewhere and by the time I’d come home in the evening he was asleep on the couch. For that whole time, I still felt really abandoned, like nobody cared for me, but I tried really hard to just ignore that feeling because I liked the idea of thinking of myself as an adult and as one I shouldn’t have had those feelings. I never told anyone how I felt, and I thought that with time, I’d be able to forgive my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to move out from my father’s house after I finish high school. I was always a good student and had high grades, so I was planning to enroll in college in another town. Things got complicated a bit though. During my last year of high school, my father got diagnosed with cancer. I had a lot of resentment towards him back then, so I didn’t give much thought to it at the beginning. I remember telling my best friend at some point that I wouldn’t even care if he died. That sentence still troubles me because it was so senseless from me to say that.&lt;br/&gt;
He was officially diagnosed in March 2016 and died in August that same year. Those few months were some of the most difficult months in my life. There were only me and him. My mom would visit, but as I said earlier, only on the weekends. I had to start cooking for us, I had to take him to doctor appointments, I had to shower him etc. I think the most disturbing thing to me was watching him slowly die. I had to watch him grew weak. I watched him lose so much weight, he was just skin and bones in the end. Eventually his voice was nothing more than a whisper. After a while he grew so weak that he wasn’t able to leave bed anymore. Then he started to have a withdraw crisis. I’d sneak him some alcohol to make things easier for him. I think that as the time passed by, he started to realize he was going to die. He grew afraid. He was constantly seeking for my company and I didn’t have the heart to refuse. We started to spend a lot of time together watching the tv or just talking. He talked about his youth and how he made some very wrong decisions in his life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while he was in so much pain that the doctors started to give him morphine. I remember, once I forgot to remove the old morphine bag from his arm before placing a new one, and I just left him with two bags stuck to his arm. He got so high that day before I realized what happened. He walked in my room all happy because he was in no pain whatsoever and he was able to walk once again. Little did I know that he had a broken hip at the time. He was just so happy.&lt;br/&gt;
I forgot to mention the smell. It was summer, and he was unable to get from the bed so we made him an improvised toilet he could use from bed to pee. The smell of urine in the room was horrible. On a few occasions the container with his urine spilled and that smell stuck to the carpet and the couch. We later had to threw both in the garbage.&lt;br/&gt;
At the beginning of August my friend invited me to stay with her at her vacation house for a few days. I was so stressed out that I had to accept. Just around that time my brother came home and I was able to leave. I came back home after 5 days or so only to find out my father wasn’t there anymore. He was transferred to hospital because of his broken hip I mentioned earlier. I went over to visit him. I really wish I hadn’t. Apparently he wasn’t the same person after the surgery. I remember seeing him on the hospital bed. He had the stare of a madman. He was delusional. He knew who I was, but I don’t think he knew he was sick. He kept saying that they’re poisoning him in that hospital, that they want to kill him. He made me promise I’d call the police. He was unaware he had surgery, so he had to be restrained to bed to prevent him from further injuring himself. I left in shock.&lt;br/&gt;
He died three days later. That was three days before my 19th birthday. He was buried on my 19th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was extremely sad because I formed a nice relationship with him during the last few months. I got to know him as a person, something I have never done before. That feeling of being abandoned came back as well, because I felt I shouldn’t have went through all of that alone. I wanted to talk about him with someone but anytime I’d mention him to my brother or mother they’d just say that they don’t want to talk about it.&lt;br/&gt;
A lot of people passed through my house during the days after my father died. My mom hosted them in the kitchen, while I was usually in my room. I remember hearing her talk about how my brother did a fantastic job taking care of my father and how he took him to the hospital. My brother was there for 2 weeks tops. I never heard her saying anything about me, and it felt so unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all of the things that happened, my mental state got worse. I was constantly paranoid of getting cancer or just dying. I moved to another city for college and that’s when I felt I was all alone. Things got really bad when I wasn’t able to eat anymore because I thought I’d die if I ate to much. I lost around 10kg, and weighted only 46 kg before I realized I had some problems. It took me a great amount of time to realize I was suffering from panic attacks. By the time I realized that I was unable to perform most of the functions in a normal man’s life. I was unable to ride a bus, unable to eat, unable to take a shower and so many other things. I remember thinking to myself on a few occasions that things can’t really get worse than they are now, but I was wrong, they could. Each time I’d find out that I was unable to do some new thing. After a while my mom realized there was something wrong with me, and she forced me to move in with her. This time, she was with me through the whole process. It took me 3 years to get back to normal more or less. I’m still feeling the consequences, but I can once again perform most of my daily activities. I’m doing extremely well at college and I’m thinking about moving out from my mother’s apartment in September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events that happened before and after my father died still trouble me. I think about him quite often and every time I feel the same sadness I felt on the day he died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never told the full story to anyone because, as you can see if you read all of this, the story is quite long and painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was 4 years old my parents divorced, a couple of years later my dad realized he was gay. I have no doubts that he loved my mom, I just think that being raised in a rural and extremely Catholic community he just wanted to do what he had been told his whole life was the “correct” way to live. He was absent a lot of the time. My parents had joint custody so we would go to his house every other weekend and on Wednesday nights he’d take us to dinner. At least that was the plan. Sometimes he’d show up hours late or not at all leaving my sister and I waiting by the window until the middle of the night just to get a call and an excuse for not showing up. When he did actually take us, he’d spend more time locked in his bedroom than spending time with us. For years this went on. When I was 14 I got in a really big argument with my mom and decided I wanted to move in with him. At this point his health was already declining. I watched him refuse to take his medication during the HIV phase of the illness which only allowed it to progress much faster than if he would have taken care of himself. I firmly believe that if he had taken care of himself the way he should have he would have had a relatively normal life and lived for a lot longer. What I didn’t know until after he died was that he was using methamphetamine. I don’t know when this started but looking back it makes a lot of sense. As I started to think about the past everything started to add up. Spending time cooped up in the room, the seemingly out of nowhere bursts of anger, staying awake for days and crashing just the same, the sores on his face. It’s nothing that I picked up on as a kid. In that year or so that I lived with him, I took care of him more than he took care of me due to being bedridden constantly. Once he started to seem “better” my mom decided she wanted to move out of state and my sister went with her. I stayed for another six months to finish my sophomore year of school and to make sure he was able to live on his own. That summer I moved in with my mom. I’d get to talk to him on the phone every now and then. When it came time for me to graduate high school, I hadn’t seen him in months so I didn’t really know his health situation other than what he was telling me. He flew to see me walk the stage. He was in the worst shape I’d ever seen him in. He spent most of his time in a wheelchair and the day before he was supposed to fly home he took a downward turn. We took him to the hospital and something told me he wasn’t going to leave. He had pneumonia and a hole in his lung leaking fluid. I went to visit him when I could. But the night before he died he asked me to bring him a couple of things from the store and I, only concerned with my first summer as an adult reluctantly brought him his things at the hospital. He seemed like he wanted to talk to me but I had plans so I only stayed for a couple of minutes. Walking out that door was the biggest regret of my life. I’d give anything to go back and sit all night and talk to him. The next morning I got a call from the hospital saying that he wasn’t breathing so they were intubating him with a breathing machine. When I arrived at the hospital the doctors told us there was nothing they could do and since I was his first of kin, I had to make the call on whether or not to keep him on life support. I was 18 years old. After a long talk with his parents, my mom and younger sister, we decided it was the best thing to let him go. I held his hand while he took his last breath. He wasn’t the best father, not even close, but he was my father. And I have no doubts that he loved me. I wish I had done things differently. I wish he had done things differently. To this day I still wish it was me instead. 

Dad, I’m sorry I wasn’t a better son. I love you so much and I only hope that you would be proud of me today.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad died of AIDS 3 years ago today. When I was 4 years old my parents divorced, a couple of years later my dad realized he was gay. I have no doubts that he loved my mom, I just think that being raised in a rural and extremely Catholic community he just wanted to do what he had been told his whole life was the “correct” way to live. He was absent a lot of the time. My parents had joint custody so we would go to his house every other weekend and on Wednesday nights he’d take us to dinner. At least that was the plan. Sometimes he’d show up hours late or not at all leaving my sister and I waiting by the window until the middle of the night just to get a call and an excuse for not showing up. When he did actually take us, he’d spend more time locked in his bedroom than spending time with us. For years this went on. When I was 14 I got in a really big argument with my mom and decided I wanted to move in with him. At this point his health was already declining. I watched him refuse to take his medication during the HIV phase of the illness which only allowed it to progress much faster than if he would have taken care of himself. I firmly believe that if he had taken care of himself the way he should have he would have had a relatively normal life and lived for a lot longer. What I didn’t know until after he died was that he was using methamphetamine. I don’t know when this started but looking back it makes a lot of sense. As I started to think about the past everything started to add up. Spending time cooped up in the room, the seemingly out of nowhere bursts of anger, staying awake for days and crashing just the same, the sores on his face. It’s nothing that I picked up on as a kid. In that year or so that I lived with him, I took care of him more than he took care of me due to being bedridden constantly. Once he started to seem “better” my mom decided she wanted to move out of state and my sister went with her. I stayed for another six months to finish my sophomore year of school and to make sure he was able to live on his own. That summer I moved in with my mom. I’d get to talk to him on the phone every now and then. When it came time for me to graduate high school, I hadn’t seen him in months so I didn’t really know his health situation other than what he was telling me. He flew to see me walk the stage. He was in the worst shape I’d ever seen him in. He spent most of his time in a wheelchair and the day before he was supposed to fly home he took a downward turn. We took him to the hospital and something told me he wasn’t going to leave. He had pneumonia and a hole in his lung leaking fluid. I went to visit him when I could. But the night before he died he asked me to bring him a couple of things from the store and I, only concerned with my first summer as an adult reluctantly brought him his things at the hospital. He seemed like he wanted to talk to me but I had plans so I only stayed for a couple of minutes. Walking out that door was the biggest regret of my life.

I was popular within the circle of emos in my grade, but I was a loser in my middle school's emo community. And despite being popular with emo girls, I was talked into believing I was treating the girls poorly. I distanced myself because I didn't want to hurt them. It turns out it was a ploy by another emo kid who liked the same girl, but the damage was done. I constantly second-guessed my actions and the responses I'd get. I had lost all my confidence and couldn't get it back. 

In high school I stopped being a emo because I didn't even like the music. I was just an emo because of my friends and with my new anxienty-ridden personality, I didn't really have those friends anymore. So I turned to what I actually did like, video games and anime. I became a nerd/geek. That was before it was cool to be a nerd, so I continued to be a loser. But within the community of anime conventions, I discovered fanfiction. After writing some shitty fanfiction about Final Fantasy, I decided to do what all fanfiction-writing tweens did and made myself into a character. It was cringeworthy to write self-insert fanfiction since it's just shitty mary sue stuff, so I tried to assuage my guilt by writing self-insert fanfiction where I was a side character helping the real characters.

Years pass and I continue writing fanfiction and writing shit for FanFictionNet. I think I got 15 reviews on one of them at some point, usually it's 0-2 reviews. I got my first girlfriend and had sex once. She left me for a mutual friend, who broke her hymen. I didn't know my dick was small until I realized I didn't even get that deep in her. I continue writing fanfiction. Sometimes I masturbate while dreaming about my other lives saved in .doc files. I've given up pretending it isn't just me being pathetic, so I started making myself the protagonist and having a lot of shame about it. I tried writing completely original fiction for FictionPress but it wasn't as fun. I'm not a good writer, I just want to live out my fantasies. Eventually I stopped publishing it at all, it's good enough to simply write it down. On paper feels even better than typing it out.

I graduate high school and realize none of my sparse collection of friends wants to keep in touch. I get a job and when I'm tired of playing video games, I write self-insert fanfiction. 

More years pass. I get a new job. Video games aren't fun anymore for me, even as technology gets better. I go from mainly playing video games to mainly writing shitty self-insert fanfiction. No friends at work. I contemplate suicide a few times but I don't want to make my mother sad. So I just write fanfiction. 

Somehow it took me years to discover Dungeons and Dragons. 90% of people that plays it is self-inserting themselves into the game. I get into D&amp;D heavy. I still write self-insert fanfiction because D&amp;D doesn't itch my need for being in anime or video game worlds. But now I am friends with a 53 year old diabetic amputee and a Vampire: the Masquerade larper. There was a girl who joined our group and we got close, but she stopped hanging out with us when the amputee grabbed her butt. I stopped hanging out with them too. I say it's because the amputee Dungeon Master is a misogynist but it's just an excuse. I just don't want to have any obligations outside of work, in case I have a bout of inspiration for my fanfiction. The woman player doesn't talk to me anymore because we had nothing in common other than playing D&amp;D together. Plus I'm the sort of person who hangs out with the guy who grabbed her butt. I don't want to be associated with people like that but I was desperate for friends. 

Now I'm 34. I'm single. I don't remember what the one time I had sex felt like. Maybe this fleshlight feels accurate but I wouldn't know. I have four different ones; each one simulates a different hole plus the stamina training unit which comes with a gold case. They're all name brand Fleshlights. I have no friends.

He's not forcing me to do anything regarding this cat.**

I adopted a little kitten from a shelter about a year ago. They had HUNDREDS at the time, and even though I knew it wasn't a smart idea to bring one home (especially knowing kittens are better in pairs and our place/most places around here only allow one, if any, pets), I felt so bad for this little guy in particular. Gray with little white socks, following me everywhere. He was fixed and up on shots, so I thought I'd give it a go. 

I fell in love with him. He was the sweetest little kitten. Always playful, very sociable, with a tiny meow and purr. But as the months went on, he started to develop behavior problems. He now pees on linens. He meows all day for food and all night for attention. He hates being held and gets aggressive with me in particular, biting me for no good reason and ""punishing"" me when I anger him (usually by brushing him, holding him, etc) by lunging at me and attacking me. And he gets into EVERYTHING -- there's cat hair and litter dust all over our counters, stove, sinks, shelves, etc.

My boyfriend, who's never owned cats, has no idea how to handle this behavior. It stresses us out so much that he spends a lot of his time in the bedroom with the door closed trying to avoid him. When he does spend time with him, he ends up frustrated by his constant meowing and endless energy. 

I have tried EVERY feasible solution, from multiple vet visits to internet forums and Jackson Galaxy videos. Our 550 sqft apartment is covered in cat trees, window perches, toys, Feliway, everything. I spend the majority of my non-working waking hours playing with him the way cat behaviorists recommend. I sleep on the couch with him (rather, I lay there and get pounced on every 5 minutes). Needless to say, my boyfriend and I don't spend quality time together much anymore. 

Tonight, the cat stressed us both out so much again that my boyfriend wordlessly went to bed early. All I could do was go in and tearfully utter two words: ""I'm sorry."" And I did what I thought was best for everyone: I went to a pet adoption network site and started filling out my cat's profile. But as I wrote in the description, I just started sobbing. I felt horribly guilty. Guilty for trying to re-home, guilty for telling my SO I'd re-home and not doing it, and *guilty for getting this poor cat in the first place.*  I thought, the best way to fix this is find my fluffy friend a home with patient owners and maybe an energetic companion cat. But deep down, I just can't let go of him. Some part of me inexplicably loves this fluffnugget even though he makes me miserable. 

I want to keep working on his behavior. But my biggest fear is that it won't work, and I'll ruin my relationship, my mental health, and consequently my cat's happiness.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before any pitchforks come out, my SO is not a bad guy.

Now he's gone and I'm no longer financially stable. While it's hard I can't quite regret what I did.

Late last year my grandfather got into a care accident. He had a stroke while driving and ended up crawling out of the car with only minor injuries. That's when we found out he had late stage lung cancer. It hit the family hard. We refuse to put our elders in homes so we all took turns and shift to care for him as the cancer progressed. That did not last long due to all of us having jobs. My grandfather raised very self-sufficient daughters and grand-grandchildren. 

My older cousin had his own little girl to take care of, my aunts and mother could not take much more time off work, my little brother and cousins are in college and below. That just left me, I had the easiest job to walk away from. While I was very good at it and it paid well, I'd only been in that job for two years. My mom and aunts have been at their companies for literal decades or just started and were on strict probation. So that left me or having a random caretaker in the home. I've always been his favorite little girl and knew that he would be more comfortable and pass on easier if I was the one taking care of him.

So I quit my job, signed up with the state care provider program( to have a sliver of income) and devoted my time to caring for him. Monday through Friday I would spend anywhere from 12 hours to three days straight being there with and for him. Pay from the state is horrible in this area and the long hours did have a negative affect on my other relationships. Thanks to being mostly bed ridden without too much to do his sense of time was distorted. I made sure he never knew how hard it was for me.

It made him so happy to have me though. From the moment I was born till the moment he passed I was his baby. Through a good chunk of my childhood wherever he went I had to be there. He owned his own hall and would take me there sometimes. I would see these rough adults be on their best behavior for me, for him. Whenever I was with him I was always safe and knew I was loved. 

When I was caring for him we would remanence about that time, watch old movies/tv shows and I would get him outside when possible. It wasn't always easy though. The man was stubborn which led to the most minor arguments, bribery and his favorite line from me ""Papa, you're a stubborn old man but you've raised an even more stubborn granddaughter. Whether you want to or not you're going to do it"" He gave me the most sheepish look and said if I told him he had to do something he'd just do it. He'd still give the rest of the family a hard time when I wasn't there but not me. Got some funny stories out of that. 

At this point I'm just rambling on. All of that to say I can not truly regret what I did. The aftermath is just very difficult for me to deal with. I know it made his last several months on this earth much easier. I know he would not have liked most nurses and it would have been way too stressful on everyone. I stayed by his side until his last breath, just like I promised him. I knew when it was his last day. I called everyone to come home from work and no one could get me to leave his side that whole day. I miss him so much, he's the only father I've ever known. I think that's the part that really hurts and is the most frustrating.

She told me about her childhood traumas and why she thinks that's the reason she can't be faithful in a relationship.  I was so disgusted by what she told me I think I was in shock.

I asked her ""if there was ever a babysitter who..."" and I kind of trailed off because I didn't even know how to ask it. Before I could find the words, she said, ""yes,"" in a really knowing way. I hesitantly asked what she meant and she responded with, ""yes, you were sexually assaulted by your babysitter when you were younger.""

Most are into meth and heavy drugs, and I just don’t jive with any of them, especially my burnt out father.  Dude is a straight up baby boomer incel that’s repulsive as fuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my sisters straight said I would be caring for my father when the time comes, as they both want nothing to do with him either, but both also mad I’m going to possibly impact their inheritance 🙄.  I’ve known these jokers for about 3 months and I hate to break it to them, but I’ll simply disappear!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, think twice before taking a DNA test for fun, you may regret it!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm jealous of damn near everybody else that exists. I'm probably one of the most pathetic and worthless people in existence. I get told this frequently by everyone who isn't my parents or an old desperate gay man looking for a fuck. So of course, everybody else seems to have a better life and/or qualities than me (well in first world countries and not homeless, at least).

I'm from that country that everyone constantly complains about and seems overly obsessed with politically, also known as the USA. I've been on social media since I was like 12 (around 2005 since that's when my family finally got out of the Stone Age and got internet, after I begged a million times, and likely I would've been on sooner had I had access before then).  It's just gotten worse and worse to be someone from here. 

All my online friends from other countries (mainly first world non-USA countries) left me after the 2016 election. And I didn't vote for Trump! I don't like Trump. Yet they still found reasons to leave me. 

Many of them became radical leftist social justice idpol types. You know, the kind who get triggered by everything, can't take a joke, overly obsesses over ""people of colour"" and trans* people, are anti-white and anti-male etc. And of course, this ideology is anti-USA and anyone from here, so bye bye former ""friends"". 

It's not weird for a (mostly white) USA person to be interested in European stuff for a variety of reasons. Fairly common but depends on the country of interest. But it's a lot of normies who don't spend time on social media like I do. 

But for me, it's more of an intense jealousy for anyone in a non-USA first world (""nusafwo"" is the abbreviation I use tbh) country. Since the ones like Canada and Australia tend to be more similar to European ideals than the USA. 

Being hopeless addicted and stuck on social media, I get to hear every insult about people from the USA (specifically whites). There's the usual unhealthy, uneducated, ignorant, annoying, uncultured, invasive, and uh... did I miss anything that can't fall into one of those?

I know it's bad to be self-loathing, everyone says that. BUT WHEN ALL YOU HEAR ABOUT YOURSELF IS NEGATIVE THINGS, HOW CAN YOU NOT BE??? Nobody wants to answer that fucking question. 

(On the other hand, the people from outside the USA who blindly seem to love the place are just as bad so don't do that either but that's another topic.)

I think the thing about Europeans and Euro-aligned places is that they're seen as exotic and white at the same time, which is a huge point of lust for everyone. Meanwhile, being white and USA is seen as downright awful, possibly the worst in existence. And all my other traits are seen negatively too. Tbh I think God just made me as a cruel experiment to see what it's like to combine all these bad traits into one package. 

Ugh I forgot where I was going with this, been typing for over an hour and it's just one of those nights I keep getting upset and crying. 

Anyway I just want everything that these nusafwo people have. I want their histories, their cultures, their sexy accents, their language abilities, their food, their look, their everything. Doesn't matter which country. Just any white-majority first world country that isn't the USA. 

It would make me so much more social to be one of them- I wouldn't be looked down upon on social media when I try to... you know, socialize. People would be more interested in me and find me more unique. The list goes on. 

And I guess I'm biased because I've never been outside the USA. My family forcibly sheltered me and we never had enough money to travel anyway. Plus I'm a huge xenophobe (raised this way) and just hate new experiences. I'm not sure I'd do any better in another country. I honestly doubt it. I'd feel out of place and like I was invading. 

I just wish I could have been born and raised somewhere else honestly. 

I know there's plenty of people worse off than me but usually they at least have *something* good going for them that I don't. Especially the ones from shitholes who emigrate elsewhere. 

Also, like most USA people, I find Europeans sexy. Sometimes. Good and bad people of all types truth be told. But social media has so much of the ""Muricans and their accents are ugly"" comments that I internalized it and now have a hard time finding my own people attractive. Trying to get over that though. Especially since my accent is hideous.

We were playing Mario Kart and I had lost quite a few games in a row now so I was in a somewhat bad mood, not that it's any excuse for what I did next.

I could see it now however, I was in first place on Dino Dino Jungle with my Yoshi, Birdo combination. I was making exiting the dining area on the third lap with a fairly sizable lead before I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my right forearm. 

My reaction to this pain was drastic as I screamed and dropped my controller in agony. As I looked to see the cause of the pain I saw a (for me at the time enormous creature) enormous creature. It looked like some kind of spider but to my knowledge at the time, spiders didn't bite so it couldn't have been. Reguardless of what it was, I was not happy which is why I did what I did next.

Because of the spider bite I had lost the race and lost to my brother putting me in a childishly bad mood. Before anything else could happen I grabbed the spider by the leg and went to the kitchen. The spider had caught me on an off day and it was going to have to pay for it. 

Upon entry to the kitchen, I snatched a glass from the cupboard and trapped the spider under it. I could see it frantically trying to escape but there wasn't a chance that I would let it. While it was underneath the glass, I got a pair of scissors, string, some cellotape and a lighter (some of you may know where this is going). I tied the string into a small knot onto one end of the string and put the cello tape on the other end of string. I then released the spider from its prison but it barely moved at all.
Still that wasn't going to stop me.
I held one the the spiders freakishly long legs and put it in the knot, tying it there, before I took the spider and all my apparatus to the attic. 

Once in the attic, I tapes the other end of the string to the ceiling so that the spider was essentially hanging from the ceiling. I could see the spider struggling to get out but yet again I was not going to let it. It was going to hang from the ceiling as spiders normally do, but not at its own will this time. What happened next is something that I can assure you I could never do to a human and would try not to do to any creature, but I was extremely angry at the time.

As the spider twirled on the ceiling, I picked up my scissors before slowly and painfully cutting of each of its legs one by one. I laughed maniacally it struggled to escape my torture. I could even hear it screaming to escape. I did this until all but one leg remained that being he one I used to tie it to the ceiling. I then picked up the lighter and proceeded to burn the spider alive. I kept it burning for around two to three minutes before it became nothing more than a pile of burnt spider flesh. I even doused the remains in water just to ensure that no one knew of my actions. 

Yes it's sickening, yes it is psychotic, but at the time it felt so good. Like I wanted to do it again and again. That was the evil side of me that I am happy to say, now ceases to exist. Even think about it now, I can't belive that I would ever do that.

Alright,  after 22 years of life I need to tell someone this. As far as I know,  nobody in my social circle or my family has seem it happen. Whenever I  feel that familiar sensation of something solid in my nose, I stick my  finger right up there, and then eat the son of a bitch. For those of you  who are wondering what boogers taste like, honestly, they're kind of  sweet, but a lot like hardened mucus. So, overall, I'd give them like a  7/10. I've tried to stop, but no dice. It's just a habit that I've  formed, but it doesn't really get in the way of anything. I've always  done it, but I know it grosses people out so I try to keep it private.

As  for fingernails, I always felt like it was a bit unsanitary to flick  them everywhere so I just settled for chewing and swallowing them whole.  I bite my nails pretty much anytime I do anything, so they're always  down to the pink bit, no white. I also chew the front skin of them once I  run out of nail to bite off. Because I do it so often, I didnt want to  inconvenience people by leaving the 'clippings' everywhere, so I just  took to the habit of chewing and swallowing them. I'd give that  experience about a 4/10, it kept my mouth busy but lacked flavor and  wasn't very enjoyable.

Now for the bit that made this have the NSFW tag. Yall remember that 'ancient' [r/thathappened](https://www.reddit.com/r/thathappened/)  style post (cant remember if it was tumblr or greentext) where the dude  says he found out his date only liked clean-shaven dudes, and he was  tryin to smash so he claimed he pulled out his pubes in the bathroom?  Well, it's a bit like that, only it took weeks. So I have this obsession  with plucking out imperfect hairs. EG, if there were two growing out of  one hair follicle, I would remove one/both of them. I don't do this  with head-hair though, only bodyhair. Specifically in the belly/pelvic  region. If there was ever the start of an ingrown hair, or I just didn't  like the look of one, I would rip that shit out with the fury of a  thousand suns. I fuckin hate them. But, as I got more stressed, my  criteria for what hairs constituted imperfect got lower and lower.  Eventually I realized I had plucked a massive patch, and knew I couldn't  exactly put it back. So in my wisdom, I set upon the task of removing  every single hair. One by one. With tweezers. And for anyone who doubts  me, I can tell you that the ones on the side of the shaft right near the  base hurt the worst by far. So I started from my bellybutton down,  plucking each and every single fucking hair that existed in that region.  Shit looked like a warzone. Blood everywhere, covered in scabs and just  overall not an enjoyable experience. The worst thing that came out of  it was the deep ingrown hairs. Every now n then I see one that has scar  tissue over it, and I have to sit down for &gt;1hr and pull all the skin  off just to access it, and then spend way too much time digging around  in the cut just to get the tweezers around the thing. Overall, I would  rate the experience as a 2/10, and would not recommend that method of  hair removal to anyone else. Just shave or wax the fucker.

Next  bit, cutting flaws off my body. My parents have always kept some form  of scalpel in the house. My father constantly would beat up his hands  and have skin hanging off, and normally I would be tasked with using the  scalpel to remove it. Now, as time went on I developed a mole on my  stomach. Little brown dot, maybe the size of a pea, but almost flat.  Like a plateau. I fucking hated it. Ever since I first felt it  developing, I would pick at it nonstop for hours. Eventually I grew so  frustrated that I grabbed the scalpel and did a shitty job cutting it  off. only wound up cutting half of it before i stopped. So as it healed,  it grew back. So I'd cut it off again. I was around 11 the first time I  cut it off. But, it didnt stop there. I occasionally get warts on my  fingers. I got one on the inside of my left hand pointer finger, right  between the first and second knuckle. That shit drove me fucking nuts. I  had it for a grand total of two years, and in that time I went through  roughly 7 of the freeze-off kits, put duct tape over it, cut it off,  everything you can imagine. One night I got so desperate because I  couldnt sleep feeling my middle finger against it, I started chewing it.  I would bite a chunk off, it felt a bit like chewing the skin in front  of your nails. It would bleed a little, but honestly it wasn't that bad.  I did this for almost a year before it finally went away. I do this  with pretty much almost any imperfection I can feel on my body. I've  stabbed my forehead with a scalpel to attempt to lance some acne that  was under the skin, cut moles off, etc. Overall, 6/10, it's really not  that painful and I find it a bit cathartic just feeling it bleed.

On  that same vein, I rip all scabs off my body. If it stands out from  normal skin, I have to take it off. On my leg a few weeks ago, I got a  pretty large cut. as it started to scab over, I would just sit there for  hours and rip off every bit of it. I cant stand the feeling of having  scabs on my body, and any time they brush up against anything, I just  have to rip them off. I find its only a little painful, even though  there's a moderate amount of blood. I'd give it around a 8/10 for the  satisfaction it gives me once they come off.

Now  for the soap and toothpaste thing. As a kid I always hated washing my  hands or doing paper mache. It grossed me out, the way that soap felt. I  remember in either kindergarten or first grade we used to have to draw  letters in shaving foam. It made me sick to my stomach every time, and I  was forced to do it for months. Always hated soap with a burning  passion since then. I find it less revolting nowadays, but I still  rarely use it. Normally only when I'm cooking or cleaning. And yes, that  means that whenever I take a shit or piss, unless my hands go through  the toilet paper, I'm just rinsing with water and moving on. Toothpaste  was always along the same track. I hated how it tasted, how it felt, so I  just started bristle brushing instead. I brush my teeth twice a day,  but cant bring myself to use toothpaste. I still keep it there for  appearances, but I just dont use it. Every now and then Ill empty a bit  of it, or replace it entirely, just to give the illusion to guests that  I'm a normal person in that regard. I very rarely have cavities, and get  2 regular cleanings at the dentist each year. 9/10 toothpaste is a  government conspiracy, they put chemicals in it to turn your children  into raging homosexuals.

Now  from reading this, you might picture me as a neckbeard type, with  shitty hygiene and smelling like perpetual ass, living in his mothers  basement. And honestly, I would too. Unfortunately for everyone, I'm  not. I'm a pretty well adjusted, healthy guy. Weigh around 150lbs, have a  really solid job in the public sector, most everyone likes me, and i've  got a girlfriend that I plan to marry in just a few months. She has no  idea of this either, nor do I plan on telling her. Overall I would say  that to everyone around me, I come off as well-adjusted and relatively  normal. And now, reddit knows my confession. I am a disgusting human  being, and I dont know whether to loathe myself for it or not. Overall, I  would rate my experience in life at a 7/10, would go around again. If  any of this seems a bit outlandish, feel free to ask me questions and  i'll do my best to answer them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright,  after 22 years of life I need to tell someone this.

I got one on the inside of my left hand pointer finger, right  between the first and second knuckle. That shit drove me fucking nuts. I  had it for a grand total of two years, and in that time I went through  roughly 7 of the freeze-off kits, put duct tape over it, cut it off,  everything you can imagine. One night I got so desperate because I  couldnt sleep feeling my middle finger against it, I started chewing it.  I would bite a chunk off, it felt a bit like chewing the skin in front  of your nails. It would bleed a little, but honestly it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad.  I did this for almost a year before it finally went away. I do this  with pretty much almost any imperfection I can feel on my body. I&amp;#39;ve  stabbed my forehead with a scalpel to attempt to lance some acne that  was under the skin, cut moles off, etc. Overall, 6/10, it&amp;#39;s really not  that painful and I find it a bit cathartic just feeling it bleed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On  that same vein, I rip all scabs off my body. If it stands out from  normal skin, I have to take it off. On my leg a few weeks ago, I got a  pretty large cut. as it started to scab over, I would just sit there for  hours and rip off every bit of it. I cant stand the feeling of having  scabs on my body, and any time they brush up against anything, I just  have to rip them off. I find its only a little painful, even though  there&amp;#39;s a moderate amount of blood. I&amp;#39;d give it around a 8/10 for the  satisfaction it gives me once they come off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now  for the soap and toothpaste thing. As a kid I always hated washing my  hands or doing paper mache. It grossed me out, the way that soap felt. I  remember in either kindergarten or first grade we used to have to draw  letters in shaving foam. It made me sick to my stomach every time, and I  was forced to do it for months. Always hated soap with a burning  passion since then. I find it less revolting nowadays, but I still  rarely use it. Normally only when I&amp;#39;m cooking or cleaning. And yes, that  means that whenever I take a shit or piss, unless my hands go through  the toilet paper, I&amp;#39;m just rinsing with water and moving on. Toothpaste  was always along the same track. I hated how it tasted, how it felt, so I  just started bristle brushing instead. I brush my teeth twice a day,  but cant bring myself to use toothpaste. I still keep it there for  appearances, but I just dont use it. Every now and then Ill empty a bit  of it, or replace it entirely, just to give the illusion to guests that  I&amp;#39;m a normal person in that regard. I very rarely have cavities, and get  2 regular cleanings at the dentist each year. 9/10 toothpaste is a  government conspiracy, they put chemicals in it to turn your children  into raging homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now  from reading this, you might picture me as a neckbeard type, with  shitty hygiene and smelling like perpetual ass, living in his mothers  basement. And honestly, I would too. Unfortunately for everyone, I&amp;#39;m  not. I&amp;#39;m a pretty well adjusted, healthy guy. Weigh around 150lbs, have a  really solid job in the public sector, most everyone likes me, and i&amp;#39;ve  got a girlfriend that I plan to marry in just a few months. She has no  idea of this either, nor do I plan on telling her. Overall I would say  that to everyone around me, I come off as well-adjusted and relatively  normal. And now, reddit knows my confession. I am a disgusting human  being, and I dont know whether to loathe myself for it or not. Overall, I  would rate my experience in life at a 7/10, would go around again. If  any of this seems a bit outlandish, feel free to ask me questions and  i&amp;#39;ll do my best to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

So in March of 2016, me and my ex  live in boyfriend planned on going to a 3 day festival called South by SoWhat! It is a metalcore fest that has a bunch of bands that participate and tour the country durring (or close to) the South by South West festival. A lot of my favorite bands attended, or at least bands that I listen to on a regular basis.

Both me and him really love music and were really excited for this weekend. We rented a hotel close by. Saved up tons of uber money, t-shirt money, and drinking money so we didn't have to worry about having a good time. Everything was set, our cats were being watched and it was happening. 

One day before the festival I get a call from my dads co worker. I was at work and didn't get the voicemail till about thirty minutes afterward. Basically he told me that my dad never showed up for work. They were really good friends so he went over to my dads house and found him on his couch drenched in pee and poop, he couldn't move. 

His friend called 911. After he made sure my dad was on his way to the hospital he called me to let me know what had happened. After I listened to the voicemail (30min later. I hate myself for that), I called him back and left work to go see my dad. 

When I got to the hospital I only got to see him for about 20min before they told me that they were transferring him to a specialty hospital. My bf at the time met me at the first hospital, but when they transferred him, he went back to work. 

On the way to my dads new hospital, I called a few friends to ask them if they wanted my ticket to the festival as I wouldn't be able (or wouldn't want) to go. I didn't fully comprehend at that moment how serious my dads condition was. The doctors didn't tell me anything. They didn't tell me where he was being transferred untill he was already there. I was in the dark.

So I get the hospital my dad was transferred to and they tell me that they rushed him into surgery. They won't tell me what the surgery is, just that it was the best way to save his life. How can I argue with that?

I'm sitting in the waiting room for about 30 hours, by myself. I had called my bf at least 20 times, and when I finally get hold of him, he asks me about our plans for the festival (at this point he's already in the hotel room)
I told him that I wasn't going and that I really need someone to help me through this situation. His basic response was that he was still going.

Over the course of those two days, I had to sit in a hospital room by myself, watching my father slowly go brain dead while my bf was with his friends enjoying music. My mother is estranged and my brother was living in Main at the time. 

5 months later I ended the relationship because I couldn't forgive him. I feel bad cause I really tried to make things work but in the end I would always hold this against him. 

I loves him with all my heart, but I couldn't forgive him and it makes me sick.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that I completely cut myself off from the music world. I don't go to shows or to my favorite section of my city (Deep Ellum in Dallas) because I don't want to run into him by accident. We used to go together every weekend. And to every show.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a throw away for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in March of 2016, me and my ex  live in boyfriend planned on going to a 3 day festival called South by SoWhat! It is a metalcore fest that has a bunch of bands that participate and tour the country durring (or close to) the South by South West festival. A lot of my favorite bands attended, or at least bands that I listen to on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both me and him really love music and were really excited for this weekend. We rented a hotel close by. Saved up tons of uber money, t-shirt money, and drinking money so we didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about having a good time. Everything was set, our cats were being watched and it was happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day before the festival I get a call from my dads co worker. I was at work and didn&amp;#39;t get the voicemail till about thirty minutes afterward. Basically he told me that my dad never showed up for work. They were really good friends so he went over to my dads house and found him on his couch drenched in pee and poop, he couldn&amp;#39;t move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His friend called 911. After he made sure my dad was on his way to the hospital he called me to let me know what had happened. After I listened to the voicemail (30min later. I hate myself for that), I called him back and left work to go see my dad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to the hospital I only got to see him for about 20min before they told me that they were transferring him to a specialty hospital. My bf at the time met me at the first hospital, but when they transferred him, he went back to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to my dads new hospital, I called a few friends to ask them if they wanted my ticket to the festival as I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able (or wouldn&amp;#39;t want) to go. I didn&amp;#39;t fully comprehend at that moment how serious my dads condition was. The doctors didn&amp;#39;t tell me anything. They didn&amp;#39;t tell me where he was being transferred untill he was already there. I was in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get the hospital my dad was transferred to and they tell me that they rushed him into surgery. They won&amp;#39;t tell me what the surgery is, just that it was the best way to save his life. How can I argue with that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting in the waiting room for about 30 hours, by myself. I had called my bf at least 20 times, and when I finally get hold of him, he asks me about our plans for the festival (at this point he&amp;#39;s already in the hotel room)

&lt;p&gt;I loves him with all my heart, but I couldn&amp;#39;t forgive him and it makes me sick.&lt;/p&gt;

Me: Myself  
OF: Online Friend  
FF: Online Female Friend  
MF: IRL Male Friend

  This story happened about 6 months ago, I was a pretty normal day, went to school, came home, and I went on the computer, I saw that some of my friends were online, so I called them on discord and we started playing Minecraft. I was really happy that day (probably because my friends were online), but then FF sends a private message to me.

FF: OF said she was going to commit suicide, I need your help to stop her.

My brain instantly went to, **NOPE NOPE NOPE. THIS IS NOT REALLY HAPPENING.**

  So Me and FF were trying to convince OF not to commit suicide in private messages, and while ALL of this story is happening, MF has no idea that any of this is going on, he still doesn't to this day.  
  But anyways, after a while of Me and FF messaging her, the thing I have been dreading that entire time came.

OF: I'm going to leave, cya.

MF: Ok, cya.

Me: No! OF Stay!

FF: Don't leave!

And she left... Right after she left the call I private messaged her.

Me: OF, Please don't do it, we all care about you.

OF: I'm sorry...

Me: No, please. I almost never cry, but this is bringing me to tears, please don't. If you don't I'll tell you a secret almost no one knows about.

OF: ...What is your secret?

Me: \*sigh\* I'm Bi, I mostly like girls (I am a girl), this may not mean a lot to you, but it does to me.

OF: I've also had a secret, I might as well tell you since I am leaving.

Me: What is it?

OF: You'll probably hate me for this, but... a couple of weeks after FF and I broke up, I've had a crush on you. (I didn't know FF and OF dated)

Me: I don't hate you, and how do you know how I feel.

While I was having this conversation with OF I was reporting back to FF, and after that conversation, I started dating OF (Who is also a girl, and who I have NEVER met IRL). (Also... I didn't like her that way but I was scared)

Jumping ahead about 3 months (Which was the next time I spoke to her after she confessed to me, she had told me that she accidentally cheated on me because she forgot we were dating (This is also the first relationship I have ever been in). But anyways, we were playing Minecraft again (I forget who was there), but OF was typing secret messages to me in Minecraft, and she was trying to get me back? I didn't realize we broke up **BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT AT ALL!!!**

I denied her and told her I thought I wasn't ready for a relationship yet because we are too young, I barely get in contact with her anymore.

Thank you to anyone who read all of this! I just really needed to get it off of my chest because whenever I think about it, it makes me feel very uncomfortable and panicked.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

On mobile so excuse the format. The title is pretty self explanatory but I will elaborate. 

I have to get this off my chest because I feel so devilish. 

Some background: my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We have a great relationship though it certainly has its down. 

So our relationship has been very rocky and though I keep using the term boyfriend, he is technically my ex. We ended our relationship because he needs time to himself and to”find himself”. Though we live 5 minutes away from each other, seeing one another was difficult due to his tied up schedule. He works part time over night in a warehouse. Anyways; my ex is on vacation. 

We broke up. And he left for the summer and I’m not sure when he’s coming back. I have a feeling he just wants to be single and have fun which I get, we’re both in our late 20s so he’s just trying to have fun. 

The past weekend I went out with my friend after crying all day over him and this enduring heart ache I’ve been left with. I came home drunk, and cried some more. I sat on the floor with his pictures in my hand. I was so hurt and upset I just wanted him dead. I wanted revenge, wanted him to feel the pain that I was feeling and still currently feeling. 

So I cursed him. 

How? I meditated. I thought long and hard if this is what I wanted to do. Now there are MANY ways to curse someone. And no I’m not a witch so I had to do some research. 

I took his picture. I casted a protection spell on myself, I lit candles around my pentagram, and I turned off the lights. Placing his picture in my hands, I thought long and hard about what I want to happen to him, and said a chant. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking I’m an evil crazy bitch. But I gave this man everything. Money, food, chances, love, oh god the love. I was crazy for him. 

Now the curse you may ask? I cursed him to have pain. A lot of pain. I didn’t seek death. It could be anything, like his parents losing their jobs, his sister getting heartbroken, anything family related I know will pain him. I hoped for something to happen to his brand new little car. I want him to suffer. I never dealt with such a want for revenge.

Edit: I get it. I know I look crazy. I know that me saying I’m heart broken isn’t enough. But no one knows the whole story. I didn’t wish him or anyone near him to die. I didn’t wish any physical pain like a plane crash or car accident. I know what karma is. I know everyone Is saying I could’ve been the bigger person and just talk to him or not place a curse on him. I know what comes around will come around. My life is already so shitty no one has any idea. I pray and protect myself at all costs. And I know a lot of you won’t believe in this magical bullshit and will stick to his side. But like I said no one knows how amazing I was to him and the pain he caused me. This is more of a coping mechanism. In hopes that it’ll trick my brain that what he did to me will come his way. I was drunk and I wanted to get this off my chest. People online are ruthless, but I promise im a normal, good person. This is merely a confession. I am not seeking advice or opinions. Please realize I’m still in a very vulnerable state of mind.

the smoke break was pretty nice. we sat probably a foot apart, watching the snow fall as my fingers froze. i was newly into smoking, and he was actually the person to buy me my first pack of marlboro black 100s. i wasn’t quite adjusted to that amount of nicotine, and i smoked the entire thing. i could barely walk and there was ice on the cement ramp back down to the back door. 
they didn’t call me back to the front yet, so he offered to show me what he did for his job because i was interested in being a grocer. he showed me how he stole drinks from the store and how the trash compactor worked. right by the trash compactor was a camera, and he moved us to the blind spot and told me that now nobody could see me. i thought it was because i wasn’t allowed back here, but i wouldn’t be telling you this if that was the case. 
next to the compactor and in the blind spot of the camera there was this huge metal door. he casually asked me if i knew what was behind the door, and obviously i had no idea because i’d never been back there. he opened it up and it was full of big garbage bags with recycled grocery bags in it. he ran and jumped into the pile of them and asked me to do the same. and honestly it was fun, i was smiling a little because it was getting my mind off of the train wreck that was the past month. 
he got up and closed the door, locked it and turned out the lights. he unlocked his phone and told me there’s no signal in here, not that it would matter because my parents didn’t trust me to have my own phone anyway. he calmly sat on the garbage bags and i sat about a foot away and up higher than him, because my boyfriend said we could try and i didn’t want to betray him. he asked me to sit right next to him, to which i said no. he asked again, a little more aggressively, and i said no again. the third time he asked, he practically yelled and i was so scared and couldn’t see that i just slid off the bags onto the floor. i wasn’t right up against him so he pulled me that we were side by side.
he told me how nobody comes in this room and it’s practically sound proof. he told me how he cheated on his girlfriend in the room with a girl who used to work there. he started stroking my back and playing with my hair. i still couldn’t see and my eyes weren’t adjusting to the lights. he kept talking, probably so i wouldn’t hear him unzip his pants, but i heard the shuffle to pull them down just a little. he had taken my hand and made me give him a hand job until it wasn’t enough for him. he forced my head down and didn’t let me move. just held me still and face fucked me.
i remember choking, almost throwing up and crying. fight or flight isn’t the only things people can do in these situations, freeze is another, and that’s what i did. i had no idea what to do, but then he stopped suddenly and moved my head up. 
(this is the part only one person knows) he tried taking off my pants and that’s the only time i did something. i had huge cuts in my legs that were really sore and the only thing i was concerned about was keeping it a secret. i told him no and fought him on it, he eventually gave up and continued forcibly face fuck me. my saving grace was my name being called to go back up front. i said i was feeling sick and they let me go home. 
a week later, it happened again. i was facing the store, aisle three because i don’t forget any details, when he came up to me. i was crouched on the floor to get the bottom shelves and he was standing over me. telling me it’s time to go, saying i should claim i’m “going to the bathroom” and i said it was a bad idea and didn’t want to go. he changed his tone and told me worse things were gonna happen if i didn’t and so i stood up and he grabbed my wrist and made me follow him. the same thing happened and i was again called back to the front. and at that point i had enough. i finished my shift and called off for the next couple that i was scheduled. i sat on the secret for a while before asking my close friend what to do. and she convinced me to go to my school guidance counselor, and we both went as i told the store over again. 
it went to the police obviously, and that’s when i felt better, but it took a whole day to have the entire town know. he was a student at my school, and i had recently went cyber but had to come in for an hour and a half for two classes. the closer i’d get to the school, the more nausea i’d feel. hallways would go dead silent when i turned a corner. whispers from every friend group and to me it felt like screaming. my job had fired both of us and nothing but torment came out of it. 
people made jokes about it, they had a hashtag for his “justice” and nobody was on my side. the guy i was working things out with decided to stop trying and my dad blamed me. i was on my own, i dropped the charges because of the anxiety induced nausea caused me to stop eating and fall back into my eating disorder.

So we live in a small town and we have family visiting from my husband's side, a coworker offered to take us to their family farm so we could see some animals and feed some lambs and calves. I went and our visiting family went, my husband worked so he couldn't go. While there we fell in love with this tiny kitten that was obviously very sick. After some persuasion and tears my visiting family convinced me to take the kitten home. 

But I knew my SO would not be happy so the visiting family and I told him that we found the kitten... He believes it, he's in love with the cat and it's been about a week now that we have had it. Kitten is on meds now and a lot more active now that they are feeling better. 

The only ones that know the truth are me, the visiting family, the coworker and the coworkers family. I don't think that we will ever run into co-workers family, and I don't think that my husband will ever meet coworker because we are not close and I don't hang out with coworkers outside of work, and our visiting family member will take this to their grave so there is a slim chance that my husband will ever learn the truth. 

My confession is that I lied about how we got the kitten and I'm afraid that he will find out about it and it's just giving me anxiety, but I'm too far in now to tell him the truth. I made a dick move and I hate myself. But I'm not sorry, that kitten has a better life now and has a real shit at recovery. But that doesn't change the guilt that I feel.

27 (f) I don't know if this is really a thing or not. I have seen a couple of things on the internet that it's actually more healthy for you, and my Dr said it's fine. But aside from my Dr and my bf, no one knows. I guess underwear isn't a subject that is brought up very much in my life, and even if it would be, I'd still shy away from revealing my little secret. I love the freedom especially on a breezy day with a nice flowing skirt or dress. I don't wear jeans as often as I once did, and if I do, they aren't super tight anymore. I actually have started to really dislike the feeling of underwear and find myself reluctantly wearing them only when my skirt / dress is too short. 

Today was game day with my boyfriends family, and we decided to have a good quicky before we headed out. We were already late by the time we started, so when we finished, I grabbed a comfy pair of black leggings and a long t-shirt. I didn't notice until I had already gotten home, but my *quicky* from earlier had leaked out and left a white stain going through my black pants. Luckily, I was sitting majority of the time because we were playing board games, also my t-shirt goes past my butt so I'd honestly be surprised if anyone actually saw.

My brother was married and my sister had just turned 18 and was going off to college. It was a dark time for me. I spent most of my time on incel forums and Reddit. Just wasting away. I wasn’t fat or ugly but that is how I saw myself. I put way too much value in “getting laid”. If I was still a virgin when I was 29-what is the point? Anyway my sister knew how I was feeling. We were kind of distant but she was very compassionate-and sexually adventurous. She she confessed that she wanted to help me but she also wanted to experience incest. It was such a turn on for her. When I heard that I started sweating as she began taking off her clothes. I did the same and we had sex. Afterwards she gave me some tips on how to fuck better. She made it clear also that this is the first and last time this would happen and not to tell anyone. After the encounter I felt more confident-and lo and behold women were attracted to me. I came to realize that the reason I wasn’t getting laid was because i was not confident. I exagerrated my flaws and wallowed in bitterness and self loathing.

Hopefully at least some of them can break out of that cult like incel mindset.

***tldr*** My sister helped cure my inceldom","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a 29 year old incel with nothing going on in my life. My brother was married and my sister had just turned 18 and was going off to college. It was a dark time for me. I spent most of my time on incel forums and Reddit. Just wasting away. I wasn’t fat or ugly but that is how I saw myself. I put way too much value in “getting laid”. If I was still a virgin when I was 29-what is the point? Anyway my sister knew how I was feeling. We were kind of distant but she was very compassionate-and sexually adventurous. She she confessed that she wanted to help me but she also wanted to experience incest. It was such a turn on for her. When I heard that I started sweating as she began taking off her clothes. I did the same and we had sex. Afterwards she gave me some tips on how to fuck better. She made it clear also that this is the first and last time this would happen and not to tell anyone. After the encounter I felt more confident-and lo and behold women were attracted to me. I came to realize that the reason I wasn’t getting laid was because i was not confident. I exagerrated my flaws and wallowed in bitterness and self loathing. You obviously don’t need to fuck your sister to overcome your sex rut. But you do need confidence. Remember that word. Might post this to &lt;a href=""/r/braincels""&gt;r/braincels&lt;/a&gt; to inspire them. Hopefully at least some of them can break out of that cult like incel mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

I then came out of the bathroom and pushed my brother up against the wall and told him not to fuck with my stuff or their will be consequences. I also told him that he better not tell our parents or I'll make him pay for it. He said that he was going to tell our parents so I punched him in the gut and pulled him into the living room. Then I pushed him down on the floor and pulled his shorts down. Then I took my leather belt off and whipped him in his testicles with my belt. Then I flipped him over so he was laying face down and I grabbed the TV remote that was laying nearby and I shoved it deep into his ass and held it there. Then I got down on top of him and told him that if he tells our parents I will do worse than this. Then I pulled the remote out of him and threw it on the floor. I told my brother to go into his room and stay there. At that point it was only 5Pm and our parents weren't due back until around 9Pm since they both worked late. I went into my room and watched some TV and I heard my brother crying nonstop from his bedroom. I got so annoyed with it that I went to his room and told him to shut the fuck up. He was crying uncontrollably and he told me that he hated me and he was going to tell our parents. I told him ""You better not you little shit!"" And then he tried to run past me and out of the room but I grabbed him and pulled him towards the window and pushed him out of the open window from the second story of our house. Realizing what I just did, I ran downstairs and outside to see if he was still alive. He wasn't. My brother was dead. I panicked and figured that I was fucked, but then I thought of something. ""I could just tell my parents he fell"" I thought to myself. So I called 911 and then eventually and ambulance came and pronounced my brother dead on the scene.

And I get waxed every three weeks on the dot.  I make sure to wash and clean every day in case he ever decides to...so far it’s been a no. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s at the point where I feel like I am not allowed to initiate sex anymore because it makes me feel like a rapist in my own relationship.  He said it emasculates him because I want to have sex so often.  He tells me he knows that he’s sexually unfulfilling but there’s nothing he can do about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to tell him that it doesn’t have to be penetrative. That we can just touch or try oral either receiving or giving is fine but he said he just doesn’t want to.  I feel so dejected at the state of it.  We’ve gotten into so many fights about it but it just makes me sad.  I love him so much, he’s my best friend.  We cook and clean together.  We have regular date nights.  We talk about everything and anything and outside of the sex, he’s a perfect boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Just wanted to get things off my mind, thanks whoever is reading this for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to see a therapist but they&amp;#39;re too expensive. I dont know how much longer I will be like this. I just want to be free of my anxiety, and be fully independent.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s call them Katie and Mia. I spent half of the school year spending my days with them since I recently lost a friend due to drama so hanging out with them was like a fresh start. The more days we talked to each other the closer we got and the more comfortable we got with each other. Until, I ruined everything. 

I started to develop a crush on my best friend, Mia (not real name). She liked me too. I could tell since she posted these “deep” edits on her Instagram about love and junk and my friend Katie (also not real name) would tell me everyday she likes me too. I decided to take matters into my own hands and ask her out in the form of a letter. She accepted it and we became a couple. We were extremely happy together liked each other more everyday. We were into a relationship for about 2 months and a half until we started to lose attraction in each other. We hinted it everyday but we both were too afraid to say anything in fear it would ruin our friendship or relationship. Life went on and my life got worse. I’m not going to give too much information on this but let’s just say I was having problems with my family at the time. My life was a mess at the time and I didn’t know what to do about Mia so I decided to pull the strings so I wouldn’t be as unhappy anymore. Ha, was I so wrong.  Things went pretty chill when we broke up at first so you can imagine I was happy about that. We talked for a while about just normal stuff until it took a turn. We started to fight everyday. I remember some days I would cry about it. God, I was so stupid. 

Remember that friend I lost from drama? Yeah, I was stupid enough to invite her over. I had an okay time with her right until we went to my house. We both were being stupid and joining my friends calls in discord just to annoy them a little. It was all fun and games until me and Mia got into a fight. My friend just made things worse really. You know those friends who don’t know when to stop? Yeah. That was her. She  would take my phone out of my hand and troll Mia say things like “dirtbag”. With mia mistaking it was me it made our fight even worse. I hosted my friend out of my house and went back to talking to Mia. The fight went on until I blocked her. My other friend, Katie, was question what was happening between me and Mia so I answered her.  She was on a discord call with Mia at the time I believe so of course she was going to pick her side, right? (Assuming that she was picking sides) She just replied to me with “thanks a lot”.

Me and her talked for a while until we just stopped. With my problems going on with my family and friends I became more and more sad and angry every growing day. I started to pick fights with all my online friendship the group chat. I still regret it from this day. They posted screenshots of the conversations between me and my other friends in the group chat with me being an asshole. I tried to ignore it other than do something about it. God, I wish I did something.

The next morning I woke up with what seemed like millions of notifications on Instagram. I read all of them. Half of it were people being mad at me for a reason they didn’t quite know and the  other half of it was my friends leaving me. I talked to my parent figures about going to a new school to start a new reputation and make new friends. Of course they said no since the school I was going to at the moment was the only one in my zone.  So, now I’m living in fear that when summer is over everyone is going to hate me.

People of Reddit. This is my first time post on Reddit. I'll try not to go too long.

I am 21 years old. I met this girl(Let's call her K). When I used to work at grocery. I been working for this store for 2 years. Met many people. It was a okay job honestly.

 Anyways, K just started working here at this job. At first, I thought she was a cute girl. We didn't talk much because we just co-workers. She sat by herself at work and didn't talk to anyone since she was new. But one day I had the courage to talk her (I'm a introvert but at the same time talk to people once in awhile but shy at relationships because of my past) and ask her why she was sitting by herself. She laughed and I ask to sit down over here with me. From there this started a relationship that lead to this. 

After that we talk everytime we work together and even walk her home. We both didn't have cars so we walk most of time. K told me were she from. She was new to city because she move time to time. We lived in Ontario, CA . She originally from East LA move to San Bernardino and then finally Ontario.

 We eventually talk about personal life mostly and honestly I never heard so bad in life. She was in a abusive relationship and very toxic. K has a daughter and a abusive girlfriend. K was raped by her stepfather went K was 17 and he's the biological father of her daughter. The worst part is that her mom knows about it and doesn't care or do anything about it.

  Anyways, K is a bisexual. I told her that to leave her but she wouldn't because girlfriend has nowhere else to go. She the girlfriend lives with K family and everyone hates her. I eventually grew feelings for this girl. 

One day at work, she invited me to a 4th of July BBQ with her family. I agree. She pick me up borrowing her Mom car. I met K sister, K daughter (she was 9 months at the time), and her girlfriend. The BBQ was at East LA. I met the rest of the family. Introduce me as a coworker. We had fun time and everyone respected me because what happened was that K younger brother decide to throw a firecracker at me , k , and the baby . I react by grabbing the baby and run to somewhere safe. At the end of day, everyone saw me save the baby and got k brother in trouble. 

Later on that night, I told K that I wanted to talk her. I confess to that liked her. Try to explain myself that I'm sorry and I know she's with her girlfriend but then told me that she liked me too. I was in shock because this was my first time a girl actually liked me as a relationship.

 From this, we started dating hiding under her girlfriend back. I know it's was bad. I eventually got my first kiss and it was amazing. She eventually broke up with her girlfriend. Then I told her that if she wanted to my GF. She told me that she's wasn't ready. I understand, So I gave her time and space to think. So meanwhile we were still dating. We got closer. 

But then the girlfriend tries to win her back. ( Remember the GF still live with K because she has nowhere else to go and take care of the baby when we were dating) Which she does. I got so mad and started telling coworkers about it and things got out of hand. I felt bad inside me and wanted to apologise but K didn't want talk to me. I went out of my way to talk her because I wanted closure. 

We talk. She got hella mad at me for the first time. But said to me that we could still be friends but I said no because how could I be friends with someone if I have feeling for you. I couldn't do this anymore and left. We didn't talk at work and move on for awhile but I eventually came back.......

So there needs a little background story for the whole thing to make sense, I am a 17-year-old high school student going into my senior year, I recently started dating a girl that I have crazy feelings for we haven't been together for a month yet but there was a 2-3 month period where we were pretty much doing everything a couple would do. Hung out every day, talked everyday and she comforted me after my first serious relationship had ended really badly and I was heartbroken. So yes we haven't been officially together long but it feels like we have through all that we've gone through.

Now before her, there was a girl I had dated that was in my friend group, Sophia, now Sophia and I had been really good friends throughout the extent of my serious relationship. Once that had come to a crashing halt Sophia and I started talking it started with light flirting and lead to me falling for her due to my need for love at the time. She was really into me from the looks of it on the outside, and I gave Sophia her first kiss. After this kiss I thought it wouldn't be right to just be kissing her without dating (yes I know I sound childish but I hadn't had much relationship experience so I thought that's what I needed to do) So after asking her to date me we end up going 6 days together where it ended with me breaking up with her due to the fact that she wasn't able to do it herself (her friend had been telling me that she wanted to break up with me). The reason for the breakup in my mind was she wasn't ready for a relationship and I was still thinking about my ex. Now a few more months roll around when I start talking to my current girlfriend, Kelsie.

Now Kelsie had been in my class for a few months as I had changed classes halfway through the year and she was in one of them. Kelsie and I bonded over little things and got to know each other really well I started to fall for her because of how cute she was and she was really fun to be around. Now, this is the point when that 2-3 month period of us being ""together"" but not really happened I told her that I wasn't ready for a relationship because of the serious one that had just ended and I needed time to heal from that. She was very open to that idea and that's what we did. Kelsie and I had a falling out where I said that I was going to stop talking to and not date any girls for my senior year. This caused her to be heartbroken because although we hadn't been dating she and I had fallen in love with each other. After a few weeks of not talking to anyone but my friends (Sophia is included in this), I thought that it was unfair to her and myself to not go after something that was clearly there so we started talking again. Not too long after I asked her to be my Girlfiend. When I asked her out she had a history of cheating on her exes like would cheat on them with 13 different guys that kind of cheating. I knew this and told her if she cheated on me that I wouldn't be happy whatsoever and would drop her in a heartbeat. I have to add I'm not the type to cheat, I know saying all this makes me seem hypocritical but I have never had an urge or a will to cheat on someone like that I feel that it's wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we get to the present day. Kelsie and I are coming up on a month of being together and Me and a bunch of my friends had planned a camping trip for the weekend (yes Sophia is included). Now another detail I have to add for this to make sense is I never lost my attraction to Sophia and given the chance would get back with her. Now with this being said when I got to the campsite it was me and Sophia and 2 more of our mutual friends. When I get there I am informed that only me and 1 of the other people brought tents. Sophia forgot her tent supports so couldn't put it up, so I said one of the 2 that didn't bring a tent could sleep in my tent and Sophia had ""called my tent"" before I had even got there. So that was the sleeping arrangement. Me and Sophia in one tent and the others in another. Now the entire time I was at the trip Kelsie was getting mad at me for little reasons that weren't my fault such as before I got there I told her that I wouldn't have service so I couldn't text her, she got mad at me for not texting her enough on the first day as well as not telling her ""I love you"" enough. So the first night rolls around and keeps in mind I am a very cuddly sleeper when sleeping I need to cuddle something to sleep whether it be someone or a pillow or blanket or something. So keeping that in mind Sophia while we were asleep slept really close to me and me naturally being the way I am I slept very close to her with no intention of doing anything because of Kelsie. Now day 2 rolls around and she keeps getting mad at me for leaving her on read when in fact things just aren't sending to her. Now, this had made me really upset and I went to be thinking she was mad at me and with me being upset at her. Now, this night the same thing happens where Sophia is very close to me and we start cuddling. When whilst doing this she grabs my hand and starts moving it down to her no-no area. Me being in a state of frustration with Kelsie and still having an attraction towards Sophia I did what she wanted and gave her a hand job this was all while fully clothed so I didn't like actually create penetration but I did make her go till completion. Now I feel like a horrible person for doing it but it is something that just happened all at once and I don't know what to do because, Sophia is ""friends with benefits"" with one of my friends. So if I start telling people this happened it would make Kelsie really mad at me probably causing her to go with someone else, as well as putting a bad spotlight on myself and Sophia. I really don't want to put my friend or myself in that situation and I don't want to break Kelsie's heart again what should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I have told her what happened that night, she was mad as she should be but I think things will work out between us thanks for all the support and the people that clearly hated me for what I did I thank all of you for opening up my eyes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m brand new to reddit this is literally my first post but I need someone to help me out and give me insight on what I should do about this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there needs a little background story for the whole thing to make sense, I am a 17-year-old high school student going into my senior year, I recently started dating a girl that I have crazy feelings for we haven&amp;#39;t been together for a month yet but there was a 2-3 month period where we were pretty much doing everything a couple would do. Hung out every day, talked everyday and she comforted me after my first serious relationship had ended really badly and I was heartbroken. So yes we haven&amp;#39;t been officially together long but it feels like we have through all that we&amp;#39;ve gone through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before her, there was a girl I had dated that was in my friend group, Sophia, now Sophia and I had been really good friends throughout the extent of my serious relationship. Once that had come to a crashing halt Sophia and I started talking it started with light flirting and lead to me falling for her due to my need for love at the time. She was really into me from the looks of it on the outside, and I gave Sophia her first kiss. After this kiss I thought it wouldn&amp;#39;t be right to just be kissing her without dating (yes I know I sound childish but I hadn&amp;#39;t had much relationship experience so I thought that&amp;#39;s what I needed to do) So after asking her to date me we end up going 6 days together where it ended with me breaking up with her due to the fact that she wasn&amp;#39;t able to do it herself (her friend had been telling me that she wanted to break up with me). The reason for the breakup in my mind was she wasn&amp;#39;t ready for a relationship and I was still thinking about my ex. Now a few more months roll around when I start talking to my current girlfriend, Kelsie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Kelsie had been in my class for a few months as I had changed classes halfway through the year and she was in one of them. Kelsie and I bonded over little things and got to know each other really well I started to fall for her because of how cute she was and she was really fun to be around. Now, this is the point when that 2-3 month period of us being &amp;quot;together&amp;quot; but not really happened I told her that I wasn&amp;#39;t ready for a relationship because of the serious one that had just ended and I needed time to heal from that. She was very open to that idea and that&amp;#39;s what we did. Kelsie and I had a falling out where I said that I was going to stop talking to and not date any girls for my senior year. This caused her to be heartbroken because although we hadn&amp;#39;t been dating she and I had fallen in love with each other. After a few weeks of not talking to anyone but my friends (Sophia is included in this), I thought that it was unfair to her and myself to not go after something that was clearly there so we started talking again. Not too long after I asked her to be my Girlfiend. When I asked her out she had a history of cheating on her exes like would cheat on them with 13 different guys that kind of cheating. I knew this and told her if she cheated on me that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be happy whatsoever and would drop her in a heartbeat. I have to add I&amp;#39;m not the type to cheat, I know saying all this makes me seem hypocritical but I have never had an urge or a will to cheat on someone like that I feel that it&amp;#39;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the present day. Kelsie and I are coming up on a month of being together and Me and a bunch of my friends had planned a camping trip for the weekend (yes Sophia is included). Now another detail I have to add for this to make sense is I never lost my attraction to Sophia and given the chance would get back with her. Now with this being said when I got to the campsite it was me and Sophia and 2 more of our mutual friends. When I get there I am informed that only me and 1 of the other people brought tents. Sophia forgot her tent supports so couldn&amp;#39;t put it up, so I said one of the 2 that didn&amp;#39;t bring a tent could sleep in my tent and Sophia had &amp;quot;called my tent&amp;quot; before I had even got there. So that was the sleeping arrangement. Me and Sophia in one tent and the others in another. Now the entire time I was at the trip Kelsie was getting mad at me for little reasons that weren&amp;#39;t my fault such as before I got there I told her that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have service so I couldn&amp;#39;t text her, she got mad at me for not texting her enough on the first day as well as not telling her &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; enough. So the first night rolls around and keeps in mind I am a very cuddly sleeper when sleeping I need to cuddle something to sleep whether it be someone or a pillow or blanket or something. So keeping that in mind Sophia while we were asleep slept really close to me and me naturally being the way I am I slept very close to her with no intention of doing anything because of Kelsie. Now day 2 rolls around and she keeps getting mad at me for leaving her on read when in fact things just aren&amp;#39;t sending to her. Now, this had made me really upset and I went to be thinking she was mad at me and with me being upset at her. Now, this night the same thing happens where Sophia is very close to me and we start cuddling. When whilst doing this she grabs my hand and starts moving it down to her no-no area. Me being in a state of frustration with Kelsie and still having an attraction towards Sophia I did what she wanted and gave her a hand job this was all while fully clothed so I didn&amp;#39;t like actually create penetration but I did make her go till completion. Now I feel like a horrible person for doing it but it is something that just happened all at once and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do because, Sophia is &amp;quot;friends with benefits&amp;quot; with one of my friends. So if I start telling people this happened it would make Kelsie really mad at me probably causing her to go with someone else, as well as putting a bad spotlight on myself and Sophia. I really don&amp;#39;t want to put my friend or myself in that situation and I don&amp;#39;t want to break Kelsie&amp;#39;s heart again what should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have told her what happened that night, she was mad as she should be but I think things will work out between us thanks for all the support and the people that clearly hated me for what I did I thank all of you for opening up my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

There's no actual contract forcing me to work or making sure I get paid, but I trust the guy enough, and so do the other people I'm working with.

One side of my is thinking that if I tell them, they'll be like ""oh, cool."" And move on, and another side is saying I'll fuck up by doing so. And there you have it, the story of how I'm probably going to end up even more depressed.

I go to connect my phone to my car...calls won't come through the Bluetooth. It's connected but the audio won't come through.

I have to run to the store and figure I'll order olive garden to pick up and time it for when I'm done...site gets an error, and the phone number automated system won't work

I needed to download a couple apps for work...app store is down.

I just want to hop online real quick to look something up...no signal randomly...have to restart my phone 

I could go on forever with examples. These all seem like little things. Nothing to get worked up about. But when you compound them over days, weeks, years...it's getting to be too much. It's like each issue is a drop in a bucket and that bucket is going to overflow.

I've tried talking to someone professionally...but they don't get it. They just say ""focus on the positives""...which is all well and good. I have the major positives...it's the million other day to day things that give me a hard time every fucking day.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s everything else. (Sorry for the language) Every mother fucking thing that I try and do gives me a hard time. Everything. It&amp;#39;s so beyond frustrating to just have nothing go easy....or not even easy..just as it should go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought of starting a journal and writing down every thing that happens every day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just now. I have a Facebook notification that won&amp;#39;t go away. I figure &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll just go on Facebook help&amp;quot; and ask the community. Upload a screen shot, type it out. I go to submit it...&amp;quot;Oops! Something went wrong&amp;quot;. Can&amp;#39;t submit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I need to put air in my tires. I stop at the grocery store that has a gas station. Figure I&amp;#39;ll get two things done at once. The air thing has a card reader. Great! Put my card in and I keep getting an error. Won&amp;#39;t read my card that I JUST used inside.  That&amp;#39;s fine, I got a couple singles. I go to the cashier to get quarters. Cashier doesn&amp;#39;t have 8 quarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to sit down to watch a movie on demand...&amp;quot;On demand unavailable&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to relax and play Xbox...won&amp;#39;t connect to wifi &lt;/p&gt;

But, my ex and I routinely send each other memes on instagram, after a few months of us not talking that is, but we usually don't talk besides that. Sometimes however we have sporadic conversations during the night. The night before this happened I had sent out my nightly meme spam to my friends, including him, and the meme was of this really long horse with three saddles. The meme was suppose to be a joke about how people have late night conversations, while I simply think about this long ass horse. However, he decided that instead we'd have to have a long 3 hour conversation about how the anatomy of this long horse would work. After that however we started talking about things like our sex lives, mostly me complaining about how I missed having sex with my ex, and him asking how he and my ex compared (Ex was better). But, eventually this lead to him dirty talking - he always knew how to get me going lol - and after a few minutes of me being resistant, cause I know he has a girlfriend, I complied and this lead to a long exchange of various sexual voice messages and videos. Now, note, I feel horrible, well I think I do, when I get depressive I don't get hungry, and I haven't been hungry since, but like I'd do it again lol, he's good at sex.

We ended up staying up the whole night do to the cow conversation and the sexting, but then he said I should come over. Note - I haven't been near his house or him in general since we started talking again. I said something along the lines of: are you sure about this, you have a girlfriend, and he was like: nothing will probably happen, and we haven't hung out for a while anyway. Tempted by sex, I drove over after a few hours, and we sat in my car and talked, well I rambled because I was drinking an energy drink since I hadn't slept at all. As I talked he stroked my legs and fiddled with my shorts that had holes in them, I didn't really care because I've been craving human affection since my ex left me. Eventually we moved to the back of my car and before anything happened he went on a little spiel about how he loves his girlfriend and intends to marry her, but he just has a fat cheating kink - he's made many fake instagram accounts to try and get nudes from women and even sexually messaged some of his female friends to try and get sex - and I just said okay because like I know he wants to marry his girl, they just have this connection. However, his girl is SUPER christian and anti cheating and anti open relationship and what-not, so I know if she found out she would probably kill me (she has the ability to do this, she knows people, I have whitnessed in prior cases her sending people to the hospital for fucking with family members or close friends of her. We then started going at it, cowgirl to missionary, and afterwards I went to the front of my car and I gave him a firm handshake and said ""Nice catching up with you,"" we both laughed at this.

Now I can't tell any of my friends this because they all know him, and my best friend is his best friend and his girl friend's best friend so like I'm at a draw, and here I am, posting about it. Funny how times change: from him being super hurt over me cheating on him (which I'll never do again because it felt so horrible), to him cheating on his girlfriend who gave up ""waiting til marriage"" for him.

&lt;p&gt;This infatuation eventually led to me and his mom flirting more and more, and I let her know I was really interested in her, and she must have been really horny, so one night we hooked up in the hot tub when everyone else was asleep. After that, we did it a few more times, and never said anything. This was years ago, and I still think about her a lot, and wonder if we could do it again. I feel bad because it&amp;#39;s my friend&amp;#39;s mom, and I should have more respect for him than that, but she&amp;#39;s so hot, and it just kind of happened...&lt;/p&gt;

My current career is ubering in LA because it’s better than the suburbs that I live in.  I drive beautiful young women almost every day if Im in the nicer parts of LA. Usually they don’t even bother to greet me but a job is a job. And women that looked like that wouldn’t give the time of day anyway.

It was mid day LA traffic and her 10 mile ride was going to take maybe an hour.  I was secretly glad though.  We talked about where I lived and what I liked about LA as I grew up here.  I learned her fit body wasn’t just for show but she was also a big outdoorsy person.  Hiking, diving, skiing, she loved it all.  

Her parents were realty moguls and she promised them that she’ll take over the family business even though that’s not what she wants. Despite our drastic life situations, we bonded over the feeling of being trapped.  I told her of my insecurities about myself and the way I looked.  

I couldn’t believe an hour had passed when I pulled up to her luxury high rise apartment.  Of course her perfect Ken boyfriend helped her grabbed the bag.  She personally thanked me and I’ll probably never see her again.  In the end she gave me a big tip and I think if you could fall in love with strangers, I just did.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a good looking guy and I don’t say it so people can feel bad for me or whatever.  It’s true, I’m a fat balding white guy in his late 20s and that’s okay.  I’ve come to terms with it.  Because of how I look, I was never that popular with girls and because I’m awkward, it’s stayed that way throughout my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current career is ubering in LA because it’s better than the suburbs that I live in.  I drive beautiful young women almost every day if Im in the nicer parts of LA. Usually they don’t even bother to greet me but a job is a job. And women that looked like that wouldn’t give the time of day anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

Ive never talked to anyone about this, even my wife doesnt know the full extent of it.. but here we go... 

In 2000 my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. She was a 2 pack a day smoker for about 25 years. She fought hard and was able to extend the short life expectantcy the doctors gave her. Im not sure how long they gave her, I was 10, they spared me the details. Anyways, she survived for over a year and ended up passing away in feb. of 2001. I remember as if it was yesterday, her best friend came over the very next day as we were in mourning to pay respects and say goodbye to her friend, which is normal and fine. The thing i felt weird about was that same night, the day after my mothers passing.. she spent the night with me and my dad. She slept on the couch. At the time i didnt think too much of it. Had other things on my mind, obviously. Plus we had numerous family and friends coming by and sleeping over before her passing as well, so i grew semi used to it.

Time goes by and it seems every other night shes sleeping over. Within the first month of my mothers death shes finally sleeping in my dads room with him. During this time she was respectful and nice. She brought her two youngest kids a lot as well, which was nice at the time. Fast forward 3 months, we ended up moving and she and her 2 kids end up coming with us. By this time they are already talking about marriage. Which i stongly protested, along with EVERY SINGLE FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE as well. They decide to ignore me, and everyone else, and get married.... The same year my mother passed away. At first things were the same as they were, but as time went on she began to show favoritism to her own kids. Which i guess is understandable? But to the extent that it grew was kind of disturbing. She'd let her kids get away with murder. They would taunt me, make fun of my dead mom. Threw ashtrays at me yelling ""your mom wants a hug"" (She was cremated, so pretty much anything with ash was fair game to use to fuck with me)

A year goes by in the new house and me being a skater kid, I frequented the skatepark alot. On my way back home one day, i ate shit. BAD. Hit a crack in the road on a very steep and large hill. I was probably going in excess of 20mph. The board stopped, my body flew, then rolled a few more feet. I was barely able to move but managed to hobble back, cradling my arm like a baby and screaming at the tops of my lungs the entire way home. As im walking up she intercepts me in the garage and accuses me of overreacting and tell me to quote ""stop being a little pussy."" I knew there was something wrong with my arm, considering i was physically unable to move it at all. But she wouldnt listen to me and my dad wasnt home from work yet either.  For hours i waited for him to show up and when he does, it turned out my SM had already talked to him. So he wouldnt listen either. The next day was a school day. I remember this because i was awoken by my SM's little cretin of a son throwing my full backpack onto my chest to wake me up. I woke up screaming. SM comes running to the room and promptly tells me to ""shut the fuck up, youre not hurt. Stop faking cause youre still going to school."" Well... i couldnt stop. I was in agony. I was still holding my arm like a baby, so she punched my bicep (in the fashion friends would i guess you could say) and said ""Im taking your dumb ass to the hospital just to make you feel stupid when they tell you nothing is wrong!"". Well upon seeing the doctor, he almost immedietly says ""Yup, your shoulder is broken. I can tell by the way your instinctively supporting your arm."" SM was silent. Doctor set up xrays, turns out my color bone was completely shattered. Proved her ass wrong, but it only fueled her rage more it seemed. She became spiteful. Took away all my skateboards, bikes, anything that i could ride. My arm was in a sling anyways so wasnt like i could use them anyways. But she had no intent on giving them back to me. Infact she gave them to her own son. Even my own dad said it was for the best because ""ive shown to be irresponsible with them. And cant use them correctly."" Only thing i was able to do was play video games. Barely. Considering my arm was completely bundled up. 

Another few months go by and my arm is healing up good, and we all go on an easy hike in the desert. We find and pick some wild cactus apples. Excited and eager, i start eating one with the help of my dad. Turns out there were little mites in the fruit, and i contracted scabies. Half of my face swells up in the most morbid of ways. Couldnt talk right, couldnt open one of my eyes. I was fucked up. My older sister (that i just realized I havent mentioned at all yet in this post) came to visit me with my 2 nephews. Drove 3 hours just to hang out with me and see how im doing. As soon as she sees my gruesome swollen facen she screams in terror, grabs her kids and leaves. Needless to say it made me feel like more shit, but i understand. She calls my dad, urging him to take me to the hospital. But SM again, refuses. Saying its not that bad and that all I need is a nice warm wash cloth. Well.. 2 weeks go by. Swelling is reduced, but not completely gone. Sister threatens to call the cops if they dont do something. So step mom AGAIN trys saying ""shes gonna feel dumb when it turns out to be nothing!"" Well... this time doctors say at this point  they cant tell what it is. (Scabies was the most likely considering the symptoms im told) That I should have been there 2 weeks prior when i couldnt open my eye. SM takes this as a win. 

More time goes by. More shit happens with SM. CPS is called and im interviewed. Nothing happens with that. Holidays were ruined by her kids, yet I was to blame. I ended up basically being the Cinderella of my house at this point. My bed was even moved into the laundry room. One year the piped burst and my room flooded up to 8 inches. Nothing was done about it. Eventually when i was about 14 years old, i worked up the courage to tell my dad what i thought about her. And how she treats me. Well, i guess by this time, he was so tainted by her that he began talking like her. He said to ""Get over it. Shes not mean. Youre just trying to antogonize for the sake of drama!"" I told him if thats how he feels, then im moving out to live with my sister. Sister agrees and I move out. Life was good for a bit. Till i started missing my dad. I felt like i failed him. So after 2 years living with my sister, i decided to move back in with my dad. Almost on arrival, SM starts her shit all over again. Comments like ""Great, more uneeded doctor visits."" Or ""No skateboarding, dont want your sister calling the CPS again."" (It was actually my aunt that called, i found out years later) 

On the day before my 17th birthday, i will never forget the words that came out of her mouth. I was getting breakfast and made a comment on how the house was starting to reak with cigarette smoke. Ill admit at this point i was a bit snarky. But i said it to myself. SM wasnt in the room, but she heard me alright. She storms in and tells me ""if you dont like it to go back to your sisters house. Or did she kick your whiney ass out and thats why youre back?"" I snapped, I told her to fuck off and to kill herself. She walked up to me and looked down at me (shes a good foot taller than i am. Im pretty damn short)  and says ""You do it. I fucking dare you."" I stare at her in disbelief   and she starts laughing. ""Fucking pussy. Youre weak. Just like your mom."" At this point I have a death grip on my fork, with every intention of sticking it in her throat.. But i dont. I keep quiet and continue eating my breakfast. That was the first of many comments about my mom. Seems she took a page from her own kids that used to say very similar insults. Only thing is... she was supposedly my moms ""best friend"".. i call her out on this and she tells me to fuck off and die. 

Because of the years of mental abuse, i become depressed. Suicide was on my mind a lot. And she knew it. She egged me on a lot. Telling me to say hi to my mom in hell when i get there. She would get drunk and say the most horrible things, like ""i  hope satan makes your mom put cigarette butts out on your face for eternity."" After a while of this.. i made a noose, measured the rope, and tied it to a wooden beam on my ceiling. One night, I hung myself. The wooden beam broke, and obviously i survived. I took this as a sign that maybe.. im not the one that needs to die. 

Eventually, I end up finding my Dads gun after a few days of snooping in his room when no one was home. I hid it in my room and kept telling myself on repeat ""Next time shes blind drunk."" 
Well.. a friend came over one night and we began talking a bit. I told him i was fed up and that i had a plan. I didnt go into details, but hes a smart person. He was able to figure out what i was planning pretty easily. He began crying to me. He plead for me not to go thru with anything and to move back into my sisters house. This went on for a quite a bit, but eventually he talked me out of it. I showed him the gun and he snatched it so fast and took off out of my house and down the road to the lake. He tossed that motherfucker as hard as he could in to the water. Somehow seeing that made me feel better. 

Anyways. I realize this is pretty anticlimactic, but after that I just ended up moving back in with my sister. No one in the family has any contact with my dad or his wife any more and at this point, i think thats his choice. Its been over 10 years since then. Ive moved across the country to numerous different states, ive made a career and name for myself. I got married to my dream girl and we have the best little girl together. Things could not be better. Last i heard, SM's two youngest are in rehab centers, and SM had a massive heart attack that almost killed her. Surprised me that she even has a heart, karma im guessing? Anyways.. thats my life.. Laid out in all its poorly written glory. Im sure some people wont buy this, but i honestly didnt put this here for anyone else other than myself. So its no skin off my back. Take what you want from this whole thing as you will. Im just glad to get this off my chest one way or another, and greatful that I had an amazing friend that was able to help me out my darkest of places.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty hard for me to post.

She would get drunk and say the most horrible things, like &amp;quot;i  hope satan makes your mom put cigarette butts out on your face for eternity.&amp;quot; After a while of this.. i made a noose, measured the rope, and tied it to a wooden beam on my ceiling. One night, I hung myself. The wooden beam broke, and obviously i survived. I took this as a sign that maybe.. im not the one that needs to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I end up finding my Dads gun after a few days of snooping in his room when no one was home. I hid it in my room and kept telling myself on repeat &amp;quot;Next time shes blind drunk.&amp;quot; 
Well.. a friend came over one night and we began talking a bit. I told him i was fed up and that i had a plan. I didnt go into details, but hes a smart person. He was able to figure out what i was planning pretty easily. He began crying to me. He plead for me not to go thru with anything and to move back into my sisters house. This went on for a quite a bit, but eventually he talked me out of it. I showed him the gun and he snatched it so fast and took off out of my house and down the road to the lake. He tossed that motherfucker as hard as he could in to the water. Somehow seeing that made me feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways. I realize this is pretty anticlimactic, but after that I just ended up moving back in with my sister. No one in the family has any contact with my dad or his wife any more and at this point, i think thats his choice. Its been over 10 years since then. Ive moved across the country to numerous different states, ive made a career and name for myself. I got married to my dream girl and we have the best little girl together. Things could not be better. Last i heard, SM&amp;#39;s two youngest are in rehab centers, and SM had a massive heart attack that almost killed her. Surprised me that she even has a heart, karma im guessing? Anyways.. thats my life.. Laid out in all its poorly written glory. Im sure some people wont buy this, but i honestly didnt put this here for anyone else other than myself. So its no skin off my back. Take what you want from this whole thing as you will. Im just glad to get this off my chest one way or another, and greatful that I had an amazing friend that was able to help me out my darkest of places.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Since the start of 2008, I was being molested in class by an extremely horny male classmate. I kept quiet as I thought it’d do more harm if everyone else knew about it. As a 12 year old, I thought I did the right thing. But I was wrong. He continued touching me inappropriately, and my heart started racing when I was around him. My undeveloped brain thought I was attracted to him. He asked for nudes once, and I obliged. It turn very sexual from there on after he started blackmailing so I’ll just summarise - I was forced into a FWB relationship with him. He insisted sex on multiple occasions but I was afraid of getting pregnant. And for some reason, I was tasked to get some birth control else he’ll spread my nudes. 

A year later in 2009. There was a rumour in my school that a 26 year old guy named “James”, was randomly adding girls from my school on Facebook. He will PM them after girls accepted his friend request. We were warned to decline his request and block him as many of my friends were repulsed by his behaviour. Of course, I did not. I did the opposite. I accepted his friend request and started taking to him. The chat turned very sexual and he started hinting that he would like to meet up very soon. I agreed on one condition, that he would bring me condoms. I’ll pay for it of course. I thought I was smart by asking him to meet me in a crowded mall. But he was smarter, he told me he was smoking and told me to meet him at the alley behind the mall. 

It was a lose-lose situation for me. But I decided I’ll meet up with him anyway. He told me to give him a hug, and I did. He started touched me for about 10 mins and I felt nothing. He asked for a kiss on the lips and I did. He asked if he could touch me under the skirt and I said no. He grabbed my thigh under my skirt and grope me for a while more. He then passed me the condoms and I paid him $10. Nothing happened after that. He didn’t rape me. I thanked him and he walked to his car and drove off. I blocked him right after. 

I went back home and immediately took a long shower. Of all times, my mum decided to move my bag from the living area to my room. She saw the condoms and confiscated it. She was clearly disappointed, but I guess she was relieved as it was a new pack of condoms. I brushed it off as a prank by my friends and got away with it. I told my “fwb” what happened and he called me a liar as I could not produce picture proof of the condoms. I guess he did show the nudes to some of my classmates, but at least he didn’t send and spread them. Many of my female friends shunned me, and I could hear people calling me a slut. 4 guys approached me for free handjobs/blowjobs and I declined them all. 

I tolerated and was at my “fwb’s” service till I finally graduated. I guess I can’t be bothered anymore. I deactivated all my social media and went off the grid. I could not face anyone. 

And now looking back, I cannot help but feel like a complete idiot for allowing all of that to happen. My family doesn’t know of the bullying. They assumed I was just a quiet child. This is the first time I’m letting all my pent up feelings out and now I’m here crying over all my past mistakes. My grades suffered badly and I’m struggling in university. My so called “fwb” is actually doing very well and has graduated. He has a really pretty girlfriend as well. If only I had said no to him earlier in 2008, maybe he would have stopped like “James”.

In High School my family was moving - I came to a new school for junior year. My Father was a really popular teacher at the time - was considered the “cool” teacher. All his students loved his class to the point where parents would contact the school’s administration and request to have their kids in his class.

I was in a new school, didnt really have too many friends - felt pretty down on myself. One day a girl came up to me and struck up an awesome conversation. We instantly hit it off. Loved the same movies, music, sports - I was almost instantly in love with her.

She friendzoned me, but I honestly didnt mind because we got along so well.

Fast forward a few years - we are best friends. Spend most days and weekends together - I have complete trust in her. There isn’t anything we do without the other (including a new physical benefit to our friendship).

I call her house after school one day, and her mom answers - she asks me not to call anymore and they will see me in court.

I reach out to her family and friends - no one knows what is up. She dropped out of school, went completely ghost mode on everyone. All in the span of a week.

A few months later I get a call from her - she was at a local psychiatric facility, she had attempted to kill herself. When I asked why she stated it was because her “boyfriend” was in love with someone else. This surprised me, had no clue she even liked anyone - we spent so much time together and it was never brought up. I asked who he was and how long it was going on an someone on the other end told her to hang up the phone.

That day I told my parents, and with complete sadness in their voice they told me what they had been informed by police.

She had tried to kill herself and was committed after she demanded my father leave my mother to be with her. She was my Dad’s former student (which I knew) and apparently had emailed him about sports teams and news frequently. My Dad responded because why wouldnt he? Jawing about prospects, trades and other random things seemed harmless. At some point she began to stir the conversation in strange ways and my father stopped responding (which is a stupid way to handle it as she was at our house multiple times a week - would have been nice to know).

The families went to court. She failed to appear or produce any of the evidence she claimed she had. Her descriptions of emails and messages that were “sexual” in nature - were reviewed by the judge and found to contain no such content. They even wanted to question me about a situation in which my Dad may have been inappropriate with her. I refused to testify - I was hurt, sad and completely destroyed by it.

Some of the things that did come out of the case were the findings that she had planned to befriend me to get to my Dad, and shared that plan with some of her friends (whom at this point I had known and hung out with on many occasions).

It was a complete conspiracy - I was a puppet and afterwards, all I wanted was to have her in my life somehow.

I should hate her and despise her. I shouldnt ever think about her again, but the only two times in my life I have seen her since this all happened, the only thing crossing my mind was I missed her, and loved her.

Some people in my life know about this situation - no one knows that I didnt hate her. It took her becoming a staunch anti-vaxx and flat earth supporter for me to finally snap out of it and realize how crazy she was.

He fingered me, gave me head, kissed my whole body, and kept whispering how sexy I am in my ears. I couldn't take it anymore and used my hands to guide him inside me.

He pulled out right away and came all over my dress. Then, he proceeded to apologize profusely all night to me on Instagram. 'Twas a wild ride.

So I have a little sibling I used to babysit sometimes, I was forced to watch Barney , that damned purple dinosaur, ALL THE TIME, I get it, he was the golden child, big deal.

I worked hard to buy gifts for me especially birthday presents, I used to congratulate myself when I finally done something right, while my parents cared more for their favourite children, I was there for myself.

So this little shi- ...sibling broke my precious possessions ( nice vases, mini status, CDs ..etc) and cut my favorite book because the cover was "" cool "", I told my parents, they did nothing because he is their little angel, I forgave him many times but one day he "" accidentally "" throw my phone in the water.

I lost it my sanity, so I locked him in a room, and took his big Barney toy, his favorite birthday present from mommy dearest , started playing opera in the background, then I crucified Barney, stabbed him few times in his green belly, let him swallow the mud to make his idiotic smile vanish, poured some gasoline on him and burned the MF slowly to the ground, he should have never survived the meteor billions of years ago .

I could go on and on about my issues with my brother. To sum it up in my opinion, I hate him and I think he is a trashy person. But for this post I am just going to specify the reasons why I don't believe his ""confession"" to his schools counselor.

1. He does absolutely nothing productive as a fellow member of our household.

He does have chores, but doesnt do them. If he is forced to do it he will do it wrong on purpose so either I go after him and fix it, or I tell him that he is doing it wrong so he can fix it, my mom gets mad at me for ""harassing"" him and she just makes me do it instead. So in the end I always do it. He knows this pattern and purposefully does everything wrong so I will have to do it.
Other than chores, all he does is sit in his room and watch youtube videos. He doesn't help make dinner. He doesn't clean up after himself when he makes a mess. (counting flushing the toilet and wiping up his own vomit) He doesn't do anything unless my mom is in the room forcing him to do it.

2. He is an attention whore. 

When he isn't messing around on his excessive amount of electronics he is doing everything under the sun to get some attention. Most of it is negative since I don't like being around him (or my whole family for that matter) and try to distance myself. He will take stuff from my room do I have to chase him down. He goes and plays unwanted 21 questions with my mom while she is on the phone or doing work. And when we are sharing stories about stuff we read that day or experienced at work or school he will take the same exact story and retell it with different names. (not really that bad but it irks the hell outta me.) In public if the attention is focused on someone else he will throw what I call a tantrum. Which is forcing tears our of his eyes, while ignoring everyone's questions about what is wrong, walking away and leaving for minutes at a time, and standing in place and refusing to move when we need to leave. 


3. He is a compulsive liar.

He will lie about anything and everything. Even if you have the clear evidence of him committing the act right in front of him he will still deny. He lies about doing his school work, cleaning his room, eating in his room. (he literally had wrappers and crumbs under his pillow and still claimed he didn't do it.) He thinks that it is all a joke and will laugh everytime I tell him that lying is bad.

Here's a good kicker if you thought I was just an asshole sibling. 

4. He has lied to the school's counselors before. 

A few years ago he told that counselor that he was getting beat at home. CPS was called, investigation was held, nothing found. I used to get whooped as a child with a belt. I'd actually say it did me some good because my mom has never laid anything on my brother. The worst that is happened to him is that his hands got slapped  for stealing.

Of course I post this one here because if I ever were to express a bad opinion about my mother's ""sweet little baby"" all hell would break loose.

I do not actually know full what he told the counselor, my mom told me the title and just warned to be on look out. I did use to harass him a lot about chores when he wouldnt do them, but I stopped since finding this out cause my mom was on my ass 24/7.

My brother is 14 years old going into high school. I really believe that this is all one big lie for him so he can get some attention and get out of his responsibilies.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile warning blah blah, also I just have issues writing down my thoughts so it might be a bit confusing to understand my ranting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about my issues with my brother. To sum it up in my opinion, I hate him and I think he is a trashy person. But for this post I am just going to specify the reasons why I don&amp;#39;t believe his &amp;quot;confession&amp;quot; to his schools counselor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does absolutely nothing productive as a fellow member of our household.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does have chores, but doesnt do them. If he is forced to do it he will do it wrong on purpose so either I go after him and fix it, or I tell him that he is doing it wrong so he can fix it, my mom gets mad at me for &amp;quot;harassing&amp;quot; him and she just makes me do it instead. So in the end I always do it. He knows this pattern and purposefully does everything wrong so I will have to do it.
Other than chores, all he does is sit in his room and watch youtube videos. He doesn&amp;#39;t help make dinner. He doesn&amp;#39;t clean up after himself when he makes a mess. (counting flushing the toilet and wiping up his own vomit) He doesn&amp;#39;t do anything unless my mom is in the room forcing him to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is an attention whore. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he isn&amp;#39;t messing around on his excessive amount of electronics he is doing everything under the sun to get some attention. Most of it is negative since I don&amp;#39;t like being around him (or my whole family for that matter) and try to distance myself. He will take stuff from my room do I have to chase him down. He goes and plays unwanted 21 questions with my mom while she is on the phone or doing work. And when we are sharing stories about stuff we read that day or experienced at work or school he will take the same exact story and retell it with different names. (not really that bad but it irks the hell outta me.) In public if the attention is focused on someone else he will throw what I call a tantrum. Which is forcing tears our of his eyes, while ignoring everyone&amp;#39;s questions about what is wrong, walking away and leaving for minutes at a time, and standing in place and refusing to move when we need to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is a compulsive liar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will lie about anything and everything. Even if you have the clear evidence of him committing the act right in front of him he will still deny. He lies about doing his school work, cleaning his room, eating in his room. (he literally had wrappers and crumbs under his pillow and still claimed he didn&amp;#39;t do it.) He thinks that it is all a joke and will laugh everytime I tell him that lying is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good kicker if you thought I was just an asshole sibling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has lied to the school&amp;#39;s counselors before. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago he told that counselor that he was getting beat at home. CPS was called, investigation was held, nothing found. I used to get whooped as a child with a belt. I&amp;#39;d actually say it did me some good because my mom has never laid anything on my brother. The worst that is happened to him is that his hands got slapped  for stealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I post this one here because if I ever were to express a bad opinion about my mother&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;sweet little baby&amp;quot; all hell would break loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not actually know full what he told the counselor, my mom told me the title and just warned to be on look out. I did use to harass him a lot about chores when he wouldnt do them, but I stopped since finding this out cause my mom was on my ass 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother is 14 years old going into high school. I really believe that this is all one big lie for him so he can get some attention and get out of his responsibilies.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, sorry for length, formatting and writing.

To give some context, I've always been mentally unstable, depressed most notably. It's likely more of a genetic thing than something learned, as its always been a fact in my life. It could be traced all the way back to when I was 12, but it's hard to tell for me really. 

If I was a time bomb before puberty, I was a fucking melting down reactor in my teens. All the new hormones and moving into highschool along with other things I don't want to get into was rough really. I was a mess, but I never really had any breakdowns. Instead what I did to cope most of the time was cut and plan my suicide. It got so bad that I was sometimes give myself up to 20 cuts a day and went through only-god-knows how many drafts of my final goodbyes. As I said, I was never very stable. 

To make matters worse, my mother was also in a lot of stress and pain at the time, much more than I could really imagine really. She has a family history of breast cancer and always got checked yearly. That particular year they found the devil peeking out of her left breast. Luckily, it was still pre-cancerous, but my mother decided to get both of her breasts removed just to free herself of the continuous worry of finding one that could kill her. She always looked so youthful, but then her true age showed. When she came home after her surgery, she was shaking, frail and almost seemed to still be in shock, all while still having my baby brother peek up on her shoulders. Even with all of the medications, it was easy to tell that most of what she felt at the time was pain. While she was sure to recover, it didn't make it any easier.

The incident in question, the source of much grief and anger, came on a bright and sunny Friday on March 4th while I was nearing the end of 9th grade. I honestly don't know what got into me that day, but that day I was just so bratty. I wanted to stay outside, to be able to avoid the sight of my mother in pain and the realization that I, the unstable retard, had to be one of the responsible obes, looking after a boy who's life I could ruin before it started. But who am I kidding, Im just making excuses for myself. I tried to stay outside and just stay out, but my parents said that it was too dangerous and that I should just come inside. Of course I complied, but also made my mistake. When I entered into the house, I gave my dad a terse ""Hi Im home"" and locked myself into my room. In further hindsight, I think he said something to me before I went into my room, but I didn't hear it. Maybe if I had just slowed down and listened more carefully, none of that would have happened. Maybe. Probably. 

Not even 5 minutes later, I heard banging on my door. Despite my attitude, Im a coward and was terrified of opening the door, hearing my mother scream for me to open it. The moment I did, I was meet with a look of anger that still makes me squirm now really. She pushed me into the corner of my room, screaming at me, asking me who gave me permission to lock my door and how dare I show such disrespect to my own father. She never laid a finger on me before and the push didn't even hurt, but after repressing emotions all my life, that just broke me and lead to me having the first breakdown in my life right in front of my own mother. I remember it all so vividly: how I chocked on my own snot and tears, how I practically screeched any answer I thought would calm her down, how it felt to have her stand over me and continue to yell about doors and respect and how it felt literally groveling in a ball in front of my own mother like a fucking worm. It's all so embarrassing to think about now, but its part of confessing really. 

I also remember the aftermath clearly, how she said I wasn't allowed to lock my doors anymore and how I need to be respectful before leaving me on the ground for 10 minutes. Eventually, I got up and apologized to my dad and said goodbye to them as they left for the pharmacy. I also remember frantically pulling up my suicide note and trying to find the gun my dad recently bought for self-defense. Honestly, I still sometimes think that me surviving that day was a fluke, as if the gun weren't in the car, I could have perfectly been able to go into the nearby forest and shoot myself in its heart, like I imagined so many times before. Instead, I was just stuck running through all of the other options before just deciding to cut myself again. 

I resented and despised my mother for years after that incident and blamed her for my suicide ""attempt"", if you could even call it that. I resented her for yelling and pushing me when I was so stressed and I resented her for ""pretending to care"" and couldn't accept her love. Most of all, I resented her for never apologizing to me. 

But I realize now that none of it was really her fault. She never knew about the stress, the cutting and all of my other issues because I never told her. She didn't even know until I was in the 11th grade, a little over a year that I stopped cutting. I also know that Im the one that takes her words roo close to heart. When normal kids get yelled at by their mothers, they get angry, sad, shame and only feel a little bad. When I get yelled at by my mother, I immediately resort to punishing myself through cutting. She didn't even do anything to start it in the first place; I just put her on too high of a pedestal. 

In the end, after years of pointing fingers I realize that I could only justly point the finger at myself. While I still feel a little bit angry at my mother, I feel better with her now knowing that it wasn't her that ruined my life, but myself. Its a lot less tiring and just correct; I don't really know how to explain it really.


To people who've read this far, sorry for the messy writing and thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im posting this on a throwaway for obvious reasons. Also, sorry for length, formatting and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some context, I&amp;#39;ve always been mentally unstable, depressed most notably. It&amp;#39;s likely more of a genetic thing than something learned, as its always been a fact in my life. It could be traced all the way back to when I was 12, but it&amp;#39;s hard to tell for me really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was a time bomb before puberty, I was a fucking melting down reactor in my teens. All the new hormones and moving into highschool along with other things I don&amp;#39;t want to get into was rough really. I was a mess, but I never really had any breakdowns. Instead what I did to cope most of the time was cut and plan my suicide. It got so bad that I was sometimes give myself up to 20 cuts a day and went through only-god-knows how many drafts of my final goodbyes. As I said, I was never very stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, my mother was also in a lot of stress and pain at the time, much more than I could really imagine really. She has a family history of breast cancer and always got checked yearly. That particular year they found the devil peeking out of her left breast. Luckily, it was still pre-cancerous, but my mother decided to get both of her breasts removed just to free herself of the continuous worry of finding one that could kill her. She always looked so youthful, but then her true age showed. When she came home after her surgery, she was shaking, frail and almost seemed to still be in shock, all while still having my baby brother peek up on her shoulders. Even with all of the medications, it was easy to tell that most of what she felt at the time was pain. While she was sure to recover, it didn&amp;#39;t make it any easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident in question, the source of much grief and anger, came on a bright and sunny Friday on March 4th while I was nearing the end of 9th grade. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what got into me that day, but that day I was just so bratty. I wanted to stay outside, to be able to avoid the sight of my mother in pain and the realization that I, the unstable retard, had to be one of the responsible obes, looking after a boy who&amp;#39;s life I could ruin before it started. But who am I kidding, Im just making excuses for myself. I tried to stay outside and just stay out, but my parents said that it was too dangerous and that I should just come inside. Of course I complied, but also made my mistake. When I entered into the house, I gave my dad a terse &amp;quot;Hi Im home&amp;quot; and locked myself into my room. In further hindsight, I think he said something to me before I went into my room, but I didn&amp;#39;t hear it. Maybe if I had just slowed down and listened more carefully, none of that would have happened. Maybe. Probably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even 5 minutes later, I heard banging on my door. Despite my attitude, Im a coward and was terrified of opening the door, hearing my mother scream for me to open it. The moment I did, I was meet with a look of anger that still makes me squirm now really. She pushed me into the corner of my room, screaming at me, asking me who gave me permission to lock my door and how dare I show such disrespect to my own father. She never laid a finger on me before and the push didn&amp;#39;t even hurt, but after repressing emotions all my life, that just broke me and lead to me having the first breakdown in my life right in front of my own mother.

Let me tell you the story.

At first grade, our class had some kind of competition, that whoever had the most blu-tack would like be the king of the game. Then someday at playtime, I heard some kids talking about blu-tack and someone there said ""Yeah I've heard that if you eat blu-tack you'll stretch more"" and I was thinking, maybe I should try?

So right before playtime was over, I sneaked to class and ate A LOT of blu-tack. Unfortunately I did nit stretch any more than usual so I just went back outside. Then when the whole class went back inside and someone shouted ""All my blu-tack is gone!"" and a lot of other people had lost theirs too. 

It was sad. People were devastated. I was scared because i thought that I would get caught. Lucky for me, Ashley had a tummy ache right that day and I started telling my friends that I saw Ashley eating the blu-tack. 

Then all the kids went to tell the teacher that Ashley ate the blu-tack and the teacher had a conversation with Ashley about how you can't take other people's stuff.

So, I have a friend, he's a 16-year-old trans dude with undiagnosed personality issues. He genuinely believes he's fictional characters. Like, I get people like to kin and rp and stuff but he, GENUINELY BELIEVES different cartoons and animes are starring him. His most recent kin-shift is Deku from My Hero Academia, and is doing his best to act like him, even going as far as expressing that he wants to hurt himself so that his scars match the show. He goes on rants about how he loves and misses ""Kacchan"" and thinks he's dating this cartoon dude. I've tried asking him who he's actually dating. Who The Real Him is actually dating, but he just says its no-one.

Now don't get me wrong, I can put up with the whole kin thing, (excluding the desire to self harm) but now he's starting to let this shit effect his day to day life. He's said he doesn't want to get a license because ""I never drive in my show"" and he insists that he's a baby. 

But there's also something going on with him. The real him. He keeps talking about wanting to die and wanting to go to Kacchan. I've approached him on this multiple times in multiple different ways. I've asked if his meds are working alright. He said yes, they're working perfectly. I've asked if he needs to unload and just rant to me. He said no, there's nothing too important to talk about. I've asked if he's still seeing a therapist, he's said yes, he goes once a week and treatment has been working great. But in the tags and comments of every little Instagram post, he makes he goes on a multi-paragraph string of garbled words about how he's scared and how no one likes him and how he'd be better off dead. 

I've brought this up to him many times and every time he says he'll get better. And every time I push just a little more than necessary about how much I love him and how I'm open for anything at any time. I tell him he's like a little brother to me. How I wouldn't be as mentally stable in life as I am right now if he were never here to help me through it all. 

I'm tired of him pushing me away all the time. I'd give anything to help him but he just won't fucking let me in. I'm thinking about cutting ties with him but I'm worried about what he might do without me there to check up on him every day.
